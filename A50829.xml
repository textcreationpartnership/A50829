            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Authors Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT was the ſaying of an Antient, That the Spirit of Man affects Novelties, which is juſtified by daily Obſervation. For any thing to which a man is accuſtomed long, commonly grows unpleaſant; whereas Variety delights him, and reſcues his Imagination from the tediouſneſs of ordinary Objects. Hence is the deſire men have naturally to Travaile: and though it withdraws one from his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Country, and expoſeth him to ſeveral incommodities and perils, yet the pleaſure of his Voiage preponderates all apprehenſions, and renders all diſcouragements contemptible and vain. And as there is Pleaſure in Travailing, ſo it hath in my judgment its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and its Profit as well as Diverſion. Of this <hi>Homer</hi> ſeems to be ſenſible, when amongſt all the Elogies and Encomiums he gives to <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſſes,</hi> one of the principal was, That he had ſeen ſeveral Countries, and made Obſervation of their Faſhions and Manners. Ever ſince I underſtood, that the World was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhut up in my own Country, I have had a conſtant inclination to travail, and in my travels a curioſity to obſerve (according to my talent) what I thought moſt conſiderable. In the Voiage I had the honour to make with the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:98085:5"/>
his Embaſſies to <hi>Moſcovy, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> I had a particular opportunity to gratify my ſelf. And, foraſmuch as <hi>Moſcovy</hi> is a Country little known, ſaving to its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, I fixt my deſign there more particularly, and reſolved to inform my ſelf, as exactly as was poſſible, of the nature of that Country and its Inhabitants. In the mean time I obſerved alſo all the remarkable paſſages of our Travails, but eſpecially the pompous ſolemnities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Ambaſſador was received: &amp; as I had beſides, the advantage of being imployed about the Negotiation, I neglected nothing of that whereby I might inſtruct my ſelf of States-buſineſs. The Voyage being over I put my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires in order, and framed them into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued diſcourſe, ſo that afterwards I had the ſatisfaction now and then to review all what I had ſeen. I communicated what I had done with ſome of my Friends, who found the ſubject too good to be buried in oblivion, and wanted not arguments to invite me to Print it. But then I was not yet of that mind, being very careful how I expoſed my ſelf to the Cenſure of the World, and I took alwaies that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to be too dangerous and bold: <hi>Nam nulli tacuiſſe nocet, nocet eſſe locutum.</hi> Yet ſeeing at last, that I might doe it under my Lord of <hi>Carliſles</hi> Protection, and with a full Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I thought nothing could excuſe me, if I neglected a thing wherein his Excellencies In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
<pb facs="tcp:98085:5"/>
the Publicks, and my own perhaps were concerned.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, beſides the General De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Voyage, and the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Ambaſſador was received, the Reader will find in the Relation of the first Embaſſy, an exact Deſcription of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> and of all that paſſed there in his Excellencies Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There I diſplay the naked truth of the buſineſs, how contrary to the expectations of all <hi>Europe</hi> his Excellency was treated there, after ſo many effectual teſtimonies of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the King of great <hi>Britain</hi> and the <hi>Tzar</hi> of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> had received from one onother. There a man ſhall ſee how unworthily ſome of the <hi>Tzars</hi> Commiſſioners dealt with my Lord Ambaſſador, and made ſuch an Embaſſy fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, how inſtead of taking care for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that Amity, which for ſo long time had continued betwixt the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> they ſuffered themſelves to be ſo far tranſported, as to become inſtrumental in the diminution thereof. And this is clear thorough the whole <hi>Series</hi> of the Negotiation, in which on the one ſide there is nothing to be ſeen but a juſt and well grounded deduction of reaſons, tending only to the reinforcement of the antient Alliance: Whereas on the other it is plain their blind intereſt had prepoſſeſſed them, and that they were contented to be Friends for the future, but upon condition (it
<pb facs="tcp:98085:6"/>
ſeems) they ſhould be required no more to give any fair and competent teſtimonies of their being ſuch. This is the unexpected humour wherein his Excellency found the Court of <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi> who cauſleſly diſliking his whole manner of proceeding, found fault with thoſe very actions which were generous and honourable in him. And indeed, why that Court ſhould have oppoſed it ſelf ſo obſtinately againſt his Lordſhip, I know no other reaſon, but becauſe his Lordſhip acted with much Zeal and Vigour for the Intereſt of the King and his Subjects, and becauſe he would not proſtitute the dignity of his Office to the ridiculous pride of a <hi>Stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> or a <hi>Boyar,</hi> nor patiently endure ſeveral diſobligations in their manner of proceeding. In the Courts of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our ſmall Reſidence amongſt them, it was clear otherwiſe: For there his Excellence received all manner of ſatisfaction, being laden with praiſe and honour, and in ſhort uſed with as much kindneſs and reſpect as could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from two Nations, whoſe Politeneſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanity are clear different from the Humour of the <hi>Moſcovite;</hi> So that in changing of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, we found alſo a great difference of Humours. From whence it is eaſy to be ſeen, that if the Court of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> were not favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my Lord Ambaſſador, it was only Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion and Intereſt which hindered them from making a right eſtimate both of his
<pb facs="tcp:98085:6"/>
perſon and affair: For it is most certain his Excellency employed all imaginable endeavors, and that nothing obſtructed them but a fatal Pertinacity in thoſe that treated with him. This being in general the nature and ſucceſs of theſe Embaſſies, the firſt makes the greateſt part of my hiſtory: for the other two Embaſſies being ſpeedily performed, affoard but little matter beſides the Complements, which the Ambaſſador made in the behalf of his Royal Maſter to the Kings and Queens of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi> But the thing that concludes this Work is an Apology, preſented by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency ſoon after his return to <hi>London,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the pretenſions of thoſe Ambaſſadors whom the <hi>Tzar</hi> had ſent to the King after the firſt Embaſſy, to complain of his Excellencies comportment in that Court. In this Apology his Lordſhip gives for his juſtification a large Narrative of the manner both of his own procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and of that of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> towards him, to the <hi>Ruſs</hi> Ambaſſadors confuſion, who had laid an hainous charge againſt him. Thus having given here a general account of theſe Embaſſies, I leave the peruſing of the whole Work to the Reader: intending to have it ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſhed alſo in <hi>French,</hi> the Copy being now ready for the Preſs.</p>

amongſt all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> that, by their congratulations of his Re-eſtabliſhment, ſeemed ardently to aſpire at His Alliance, the <hi>Tzar</hi> of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> had the moſt equitable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. For, beſides that admirable Sympathy which has been ſo long time betwixt the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and the great Dukes of <hi>Moſcovy, Alexey Michailovitz</hi> the preſent Duke had ſo great an abhorrency of the murther of King CHARLES the Firſt, that he reſolved in ſome meaſure to revenge it upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company at <hi>Archangel,</hi> whom he looked upon as aſſertors if not aſſociates in the Rebellion. And as a certain inſtance of the conſtancy of his affection, he no ſooner underſtood the calamities Our preſent King was reduced to, but he aſſiſted him immediately with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſum of money. From hence it was that his Majeſty gave his Ambaſſadors ſo great a Reception, as made the Friendſhip he had for that great Monarch conſpicuous to all the World.</p>
            <p>And it was this Embaſſage from the <hi>Tzar,</hi> and thoſe from the Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> that gave occaſion to his Majeſty of Great <hi>Britain</hi> to return theſe, which are the preſent matter of this Relation: The firſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy was addreſſed to the Great Duke of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> The ſecond to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> The third to the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> It is true, the firſt had, beſide <hi>That,</hi> a peculiar ſubject of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98085:10"/>
Importance, touching Commerce at <hi>Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> in <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> viz. <hi>To obtain a re-eſtabliſhment of the Priviledges of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Company, which conſiſted in this, That the Merchants of this Kingdom did formerly trade into that place without paying any Impoſt.</hi> Which Immunity was but a generous recompence, that one of the former Dukes, <hi>Ivan Baſilovitz,</hi> made the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for their diſcovery of that Port, and introduction of ſo conſiderable a Commerce thither.</p>
            <p>The preſent Great Duke had vacated theſe Priviledges in the time of the late Rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe conceiving the Merchants complices in that rebellion, he eſteemed them unworthy of his favour, &amp; therefore of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer theſe Immunities. The Company having ſince that time, to the happy Return of his Majeſty, been deprived of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, the King by this Embaſſage deſired things might be reſtored to their former ſtate, and that upon two principal conſiderations. One, <hi>becauſe his Subjects (for whoſe rebellion they were taken away,) were returned again to their obedience;</hi> The other, <hi>becauſe theſe very Priviledges were the baſis and foundation, upon which the Amity betwixt the two Crowns of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Moſcovy <hi>were ſuperſtructed.</hi> And theſe were two fundamental Reaſons, that were ſtrong enough to induce his Majeſty to hope for ſucceſs in his Demand, but he could
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98085:11"/>
expect no leſs from the generoſity and promiſe of the <hi>Tzar.</hi> Yet He was flatly refuſed, as if the <hi>Tzars</hi> kindneſs had been already quite exhauſted.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> to whom the King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged theſe Embaſſies was without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, in all reſpects proper for the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For, beſides that he was of a comely and advantageous ſtature, a Majeſtick mine, and not above four and thirty years of age, he had a peculiar grace and vivacity in his diſcourſe, and in his actions a great prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and diligence. In a word, he was ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all perfections that could render a man acceptable, and eſpecially with thoſe that were requiſite for the diſcharge of ſo important an affair.</p>

            <p>His Train conſiſted of near fourſcore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; amongſt which he had ten Gentlemen, ſix Pages, two Trumpets, and twelve Footmen. He had alſo a Chaplain, ſeveral Interpreters, a Chirurgeon, ſix Muſicians, beſides many Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were very neceſſary in <hi>Moſcovy.</hi> And foraſmuch as his Excellence was to begin that way the circle of his Embaſſies, (to the end he might come back by <hi>Liefland</hi> into <hi>Sweden,</hi> by <hi>Sweden</hi> into <hi>Denmark;</hi> and from thence come into <hi>England</hi>) before his departure he provided himſelf of all ſuch neceſſary things
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98085:11"/>
as <hi>Ruſſia</hi> could ſcarce afford. So that, beſides the <hi>Liveries</hi> which were made at <hi>London,</hi> he was alſo forced to provide himſelf of Beds &amp; Chairs, and even of all Kitchin-moveables, only the Chimney excepted, and that would have been too moſt ſerviceable in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Beſides theſe, his Majeſty provided his Excellency with a magnificent Canopy of red Damaſk, ſurrounded with a gold and ſilver Fringe, and having on the back in a large circle the Arms of the King of <hi>England,</hi> richly embroidered with ſilver, together with a very rich Chair of State having its Footſtool. For other things it is the cuſtome of the <hi>Tzar</hi> to defray the charges of all foreign Ambaſſadors from their Entrance into his Dominions, till the time they are out of them.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, all things being thus provided, we prepared to depart in the month of <hi>July</hi> 1663. but before we come to the particular relation of our Voiage, it will not be incongruous to give ſome general notions of its extent.</p>
            <p>The whole Voiage contained at leaſt eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred leagues, that is to ſay, upon the Northern Seas betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Archangel,</hi> ſeven hundred and fifty: from <hi>Archangel</hi> to <hi>Vologda</hi> by water up the Rivers <hi>Duina</hi> and <hi>Sucagna</hi> in <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> two hundred and fifty leagues; after that an hundred leagues at leaſt from <hi>Vologda</hi> to <hi>Moſco,</hi> by Land. So that the way the Ambaſſador went, his Voiage
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98085:12"/>
from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Moſco</hi> (which is the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan in <hi>Moſcovy</hi>) made up eleven hundred leagues. From <hi>Moſco</hi> to <hi>Riga</hi> the principal City in <hi>Livonia,</hi> we travelled two hundred and fifty leagues, the moſt part by Land, which ſaid Town is under the Dominion of the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> From <hi>Riga</hi> we paſſed an hundred leagues upon the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> the capital City in <hi>Swedeland.</hi> From <hi>Stockholm</hi> by Sea alſo an hundred leagues more to <hi>Copenhagen</hi> in <hi>Denmark,</hi> where his Excellence concluded his Embaſſies. And from thence returning to <hi>London,</hi> he made a Tour at the leaſt of two hundred and fifty leagues more.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THere were two Veſſels appointed for this Voiage: One, a Man of war of 50. pieces of Ordnance, The other a Merchants ſhip; which laſt ſet ſayle before the other with twenty two of his Lordſhips Domeſticks, of which number I was one. A great part of his baggage, and of the Preſents his Majeſty ſent to the great Duke, were diſpoſed in this Veſſel alſo, beſides eight Coach horſes. In this manner we embarked from <hi>London</hi> for <hi>Graveſend,</hi> where our ſhip lay at anchor in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98085:12"/>
the <hi>Thames,</hi> with the Man of war, in which the Ambaſſador was to come after us very ſhortly.</p>
               <p>But after we were embarked, there was an unlucky accident befel one of our Company, who fell down upon the hatches, and hurt himſelf in ſeveral places of his body; ſo that we thought fit to get him carried immediately aſhore into <hi>Graveſend,</hi> where he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo ill, that we concluded his journey would be at an end before it was well begun. This perſon was of the number of them to whom the generoſity of the Ambaſſador had given leave to tranſport themſelves for <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covie,</hi> and to croſs thoſe Countries with his Train. His Excellence being arrived at <hi>Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end</hi> in order to his embarkment, received him into his Veſſel, where in a ſhort time he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſo well, that he made a match with one of the Maid-ſervants, and ſo gave us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the entertainment of a Marriage at <hi>Moſco.</hi> However this fall proved to be but a happy fall, foraſmuch as by that means he leapt out of a Merchants ſhip into one of the King's Men of war well provided, and much happier in this Voiage than ours. There they were entertained all the way with the ſound of Trumpets, and the melody of Muſick, whilſt we (Strangers to all theſe divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) had no other harmony than what is ordinarily concomitant with the ſickneſs of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98085:13"/>
the Sea; in which the moſt of us bore our parts.</p>
               <p>On the 15<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> we ſet ſayle from <hi>Graveſend,</hi> with a favourable gale to fall down the River. But ſhortly after the wind turned ſo croſs and violent, that for the ſpace of ſeven or eight days we were all in a very ſad and diſmal conſternation, and thoſe chiefly who were but ſtrangers to theſe confuſions as yet. It is true we had now and then a little calm weather, and chiefly the 21. which gave us the opportunity of entertaining our ſelves with the ſight of a Porpoiſe of an exceeding bigneſs, for a full quarter of an hour. She gave us great diverſion with her conſtant plungings and leapings in the water, on each ſide of our Ship, as if ſhe had come on purpoſe to make us that Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But, as if all that had been but ſo many preſages of a grievous Storm, and a Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication of croſſes impending us, preſently after the wind was at North-Eaſt, which was directly contrary and continued there four days with a very great violence. And ſo that Sea, which in the calm appeared like an azure field, wherein the fiſhes ſported themſelves with the wanton expreſſions of their joy, on a ſudden became a place of horror, of mountains, and abyſſes, combating one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the violence of the winds, the foaming waves toſſing up our Veſſel to the clouds,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98085:13"/>
and in an inſtant re-plunging it in the bottom of the Sea; and the Ocean after ſo pleaſant a calm bellowing and roaring with incredible fury ſo long a time together.</p>
               <p>At laſt we came in ſight of <hi>Norway,</hi> and here we ſollicited the Maſter to go to an harbour which was in ſight of us, and ſtay there till the wind ſerved. But he refuſed it, alledging in his excuſe, that he came out very late from <hi>England</hi> to make ſo long a Voiage, that it was unſeaſonable to divert our ſelves with recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations aſhore, that he was obliged to keep himſelf at Sea as much as was poſſible, ſo that he might be ready to make his advantage of the firſt favourable wind. By all which we quickly diſcerned that we had not to do with an <hi>Aceſſaeus,</hi> who was alwaies coyning of pretences to delay his voiage, and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Moon that ſhe was no more propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to his Navigation. Our Maſter on the contrary would anticipate his oppotunities, and reſolved however to manage his Veſſel in ſpight of the inclemency of the Heavens. He was an old Sea-man, ſo accuſtomed to the air of the Sea, that he ſcarce ſubſiſted but on Shipboord, and never lived but by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on ſhore. Which made one ſay, That he feared leſt the Maſter being become by cuſtom an <hi>Amphibium</hi> already, ſhould at laſt degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into ſome Sea-monſter; and that if he had lived in the time of the antient Pagans,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98085:14"/>
when the Gods transformed Men and Women into Stones, Trees, and Birds, it would have been no hard matter to have Metamorphiſed him at leaſt into a Man-fiſh, his diſpoſition contributing ſo much thereunto.</p>
               <p>The 26. the wind increaſed with ſuch fury, that it blew down and brake in pieces the ſcuttle of our main Maſt, tore our main Sayle, and ſprung one of our maſts, ſo that it hung looſe among the Tackling. At firſt this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter was very dreadful, but we turned it preſently into an occaſion of joy: intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling with the common apprehenſion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary danger, a ſecret hope of being for ſome time delivered from the importunity of the Sea. And indeed the Maſter himſelf whoſe great refractorineſs had carried us into ſo many extremities, diſpoſed himſelf at laſt to ſtrike ſayl to the tempeſt, and turning to the Weſt, we ſtood in for <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> to repair our Ship which the ſtorm had reduced to a very ill condition. Upon which nothing was to be ſeen amongſt us but tranſportation and joy, every body bleſſing God for the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation we had drawn out of this accident, and in a moment forgetting our ſorrows that were paſt, we pleaſed our ſelves as much that we were making for <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> though it was ſixty leagues backward, as if we had been arriving at <hi>Archangel,</hi> and ready to put an end to a terrible and a tedious Voiage. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98085:14"/>About noon the next day the wind having done its worſt, left us as it were ſtanding ſtill, a calm, after we had diſcovered the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Cheviot</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi> At length about the Evening we had a South-Weſt wind, which ſerved only to inveigle us further into the fury of the ſame wind that had ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed us already, and expoſe us afreſh to the ſame dangers we had almoſt overcome. For though it was but a little gale, yet the Maſter and Pilot puft up with inſignificant hope, thought it beſt to make advantage of ſo rare an occaſion, perſwading themſelves by the opinion of their Carpenters, that their ſcuttle and maſt might be mended well enough at Sea, to hold out to <hi>Archangel.</hi> Inſomuch as they peremptorily reſolved, to turn their backs upon <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and addreſs themſelves once more to their Voiage to <hi>Moſcovy.</hi> So that having made near ſixty leagues in leſs than four and twenty houres, and being come within ſix or ſeven leagues of the ſhore, here we ſaw by a ſad diſappointment the end of our joy, and the fruit of our expectations. And</p>
               <p>The next morning the wind turned North-Eaſt again, with its old impetuoſity and rage, as if it had retreated only to redouble its force. The Maſter, far from looking out any refuge, imployed his Carpenters all this while about his ſcuttle and maſt. Whereupon, being
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98085:15"/>
all very impatient of our condition, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves ſlaves to the brutality of an inſupportable perſon, that delighted himſelf as it were, to make us a ſport to the winds, expoſing altogether to the mercy of the ſtorms in a ſhattered bruiſed Veſſel our lives, His Majeſties and his Ambaſſadors goods, two of his Excellencies Gentlemen amongſt the reſt of our Company expoſtulated with him boldly, and proteſted his rude proceeding ſhould not go unpuniſhed. But all this would not move him, Rigour having no better an effect upon him than good Nature. This ſon of the Sea forbore not ſtill for ſome time to exerciſe our patience by the enraged Ocean, that ſeemed to threaten the very Heavens themſelves. At laſt, on the 29. the weather befriended us with as favourable an accident as befel us before, for the Bolt-ſprit being looſe, the Maſter made preſently what ſayle he could for <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> which was then ſome fifty leagues from us. But the wind conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us twenty leagues further, and we were glad the next day to put into <hi>Burlington,</hi> a Harbour in the County of <hi>York.</hi> There we were no ſooner come to an anchor, but we went immediately on ſhore to refreſh and take ſome neceſſary repoſe after ſo great incommodities at Sea.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, while we ſtaid in this Harbour till our Ship was repaired, Mr. <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98085:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a Gentleman who had the direction of our Company, was commanded away by General <hi>Monck</hi> upon occaſion of a new Mutiny of Fanaticks in <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> which was ſoon after happily ſuppreſſed, ſeveral of the Mutineers having been executed. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion we heard of aſſoon as we came to the Harbour; and Mr. <hi>Watſon,</hi> who had a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Command in his Majeſties Guards, was therefore adviſed by a friend of his Sir <hi>Thomas Gower,</hi> then High Sherif of <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi> (whom he met with) to acquaint ſpeedily General <hi>Monck</hi> with his being at <hi>Burlington,</hi> that in caſe the General ſhould have had occaſion for him in that conjuncture he might receive his commands. Mr. <hi>Watſon</hi> followed this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and writ accordingly to the General, though indeed he was very loth to break off his Voiage, and to undergo after ſo many troubles the fruſtration of the deſire he had to ſee particularly the Country of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> whereunto nothing had engaged him but his own curioſity. At length having received no anſwer at the return of the Poſt, the wind being turned fair, and our Ship being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently repaired, he prepared himſelf for his embarkment with us, rather than wait any longer for an anſwer to the prejudice of the Ambaſſadors affaires. But juſt as he was put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his foot, as it were, into the boat, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Orders from General <hi>Monck</hi> to return
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98085:16"/>
immediately to <hi>London</hi> about his military Office. Whereupon he came aboard our Ship, and having writ an account of the buſineſs to the Ambaſſador he was reconveyed on ſhore, to the great diſſatisfaction of all our Company. And ſo, having ſtaid nine whole days at <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 8. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> we ſailed away for <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel,</hi> reduced to a leſſer number by three or four perſons. From thence the weather was ſo favourable, that whereas before we had ſpent three weeks and three days making but four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore leagues, we finiſhed our Voiage within a ſmall matter in the ſame proportion of time.</p>
               <p>It is true we had not above eight or nine days of fair wind, but it was ſo propitious, that in five days (from the 11. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the 16.) we made near four hundred leagues. The 12. we left <hi>Shetland</hi> to the leeward, and the next day we had ſo great a ſtorm, that one of our Yards was broken in the middle, and we compelled to ſlacken our ſailes. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we reckoned this tempeſt benign, as long as it did contribute to the good expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Voiage.</p>
               <p>The 20. and 21. were ſo foggy that we could ſcarce diſcern one another upon the Decks; whereas, when the weather was cleer, we had ſo little darkneſs, that from Sun ſetting to Sun riſing it ſeemed a continual Twy-light. Nevertheleſs, about this time we began to be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98085:16"/>
very much incommoded with cold, which brought our ſtrong-waters into very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt among us, eſpecially after we had on the 22. diſcovered the Iſles of <hi>Ruſt</hi> and <hi>Gromſond</hi> all covered over with ſnow.</p>
               <p>The 26. ſayling South-Eaſt, we paſt on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>North-Cape,</hi> having left ſeveral Mountainous Iſlands to the windward of us, and coaſting for ſome time along <hi>Capland,</hi> we came in few days upon the Coaſt of <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond of September we had the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement to ſee our ſelves ſurrounded by great numbers of Fiſh, ſolacing and ſporting in the calm; and though according to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Sea-men, and the experience we had often had, it was ordinarily a preſage of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll weather, yet to us it appeared that we were not capable of a more acceptable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amidſt the delays of a calm: and here it was we diſcovered a great Whale, playing in the Sea ſome two or three leagues off us. About noon we had a gentle gale that gave us a ſight of the Embaſſadors Frigat, by which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood his Excellence was long ſince arrived at <hi>Archangel,</hi> that he was perſwaded we were caſt away, and reſolved, if he had no news of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>As this news (which we received but by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, as the Frigat was returning into <hi>England</hi>)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98085:17"/>
gave us no ſmall joy on the one ſide, ſo on the other, it was a great trouble to find our ſelves ſixty leagues from our Port, expoſed to the fury of a wind, that was already rallying its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to beat us back, and did effectually repel us, ſo as</p>
               <p>The next day we were obliged to caſt anchor towards the point of <hi>Orlogones,</hi> for the more certain evaſion of the Rocks and Sand-banks that encompaſt us. In the mean time, five or ſix of our men, and as many Seamen, made a a party to go on ſhore, and ſee how that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was inhabited, and expecting to meet ſtore of wild beaſts, amongſt other weapons they took their fire Arms alſo. They ſtayed on ſhore about five or ſix hours, but ſo incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the coldneſs of the wind, that they were conſtrained to cut down a wooden croſs, (they found newly erected near the ſea ſide) to make a fire therewith to warm themſelves: the remainder of which they brought along with them aboard to do as much for us; for we had already conſumed almoſt all our ſeacoals. They brought us alſo a Bottle of freſh water, as ſweet as liquorice, which they had from a Rock near the ſea ſide, which the Maſter lik'd ſo well, he reſolved the next day to fill two or three Tun with it, for that moſt of our water was corrupted.</p>
               <p>The 4. the wind turned, but we eſcapt very narrowly being wreckt. For, a little after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98085:17"/>
as we were weighing anchor, in the midſt of the tempeſt and rain, we found our ſelves violently forced among the Rocks by the fury of the Sea, and the Tide driving us inevitably on ground; inſomuch, as the Maſter diſpairing to get the ſhip off, with a moſt lamentable voice cryed out, <hi>All is loſt.</hi> His rocky heart at laſt melted at the ſight of thoſe Rocks that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed us, and he whom the moſt outragious ſurges of the Sea could not terrifie, trembled then at the ſight of a Rock; inſomuch, as to have ſeen him then, one would have thought no body had been in danger but he, ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was he ſurpriſed with amazement and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. And now it was, every one put his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs into order, and he being in expectation every moment of daſhing in pieces, and give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us the alarm, moſt of us prepared our ſelves to ſwim, if we could to Land, which was not far from us. For my part, I took up <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, who being almoſt in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thought it beſt to keep in his ſhip, till it was broke in pieces, &amp; then (ſaid he) when the Waves have deſtroyed my Veſſel, will be the beſt time for me to ſwim, for then a man has nothing elſe to mind. But God Almighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us from this deſperate extremity, ſo that having with much labour weighed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, we cleered our ſelves beyond all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, &amp; doubling the point of <hi>Orlogones,</hi> we made forty leagues that day upon the white
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98085:18"/>
ſea, and that evening we came up as high as <hi>Catſnoſe,</hi> which we left to the lee-ward.</p>
               <p>The 5. of <hi>Septemb.</hi> was the day whereon we arrived happily at <hi>Archangel;</hi> but before we got in, we ran a great hazard at the Bar of <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel,</hi> where the Duina diſ-imbogues it ſelf: and where we ſaw a <hi>Holland</hi> Merchant man that was newly wreckt there. The reaſon was, the ſea was ſo ſhallow, that we had not above a foot or two water to ſpare, ſo that when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the River, we were brought to that extremity, that our ſhip ran on ground; where we were conſtrained to continue till evening, when the Tide came in. During which time, the maſter with another Gentleman went on ſhore to <hi>Archangel,</hi> to give his Excellence no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our arrivall. The tide coming in, the ſhip that lay but lightly upon the ground, was diſ-ingaged in that manner, that we all arrived at <hi>Archangel</hi> in three hours, where we were recived by our companions with all imaginable joy: ſo that it was no eaſie matter to determine which ſide thought it ſelf moſt happy, we, who were arrived, or they, that we were ſo.</p>

               <head>Of the Ambaſſadors Voyage, and of his Entry into the Town of <hi>Archangel.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IF our Voyage was full of troubles and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters, I dare on the other ſide affirm, there was ſcarce ever any ſo happy as the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors. For without mentioning the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and convenience of his ſhip, I ſhall only relate, that whereas we ſpent ſeven compleat weeks betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Archangel,</hi> his Excellencie made the whole Voyage of ſeven hundred and fifty leagues, in leſs than a moneth: for, having ſet ſaile from <hi>Graveſend</hi> the 22. of <hi>July</hi> which was eight daies after us, he arrived the 19. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> at the Barr of <hi>Archangel,</hi> which was ſeventeen daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. And there it was his Frigat came firſt to an anchor, in expectation of Orders for his Entry, for which reaſon he ſent Mr. <hi>Marvel</hi> his Secretary into the Town. Of whoſe land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Governour having notice, ordered him to be conducted by ſix Gentlemen to the Caſtle, through a Regiment of ſix hundred men, and the next day he ſent ſixteen boats, guarded by ſeveral hundreds of men, under the command of a Collonel, to receive his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, and bring him aſhore.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors Entry into <hi>Archangel</hi> was made the 23. in a remarkable manner:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98085:19"/>
For, beſides the ſixteen boats which were ſent to attend upon the Ambaſſador, there was a Barque particularly trim'd for his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, beſides <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>veral others dreſt up with Tapeſtry, that came to meet him, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him to the Town above halfe a league, whilſt ſeveral ſhips, men of War and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-men, both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore not to congratulate his Entry with the noiſe of their Canon, which is not much in uſe amongſt the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> unleſs in their wars. And juſt as his Excellence was landing, upon a wooden bridg, he was prevented by a certain Collonel, called <hi>Bogdan,</hi> who came to complement him, according to their mode, and to declare himſelf deputed to attend him as <hi>Priſtaffe</hi> (which is the Title they give ſuch as are appointed to receive foreign Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and to take care of their paſſage and proviſions) The Ambaſſador having replied to him very handſomely, began to advance towards the lodging which was prepared for him: but as he was ſetting the firſt ſtep, the <hi>Priſtaff</hi> took the upper hand of him. And this was an inſtance of the great rudeneſs and inſolence of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> (of which we ſhall have future occaſion to ſpeak more largely) which is the ordinary method they uſe to thoſe Ambaſſadors, upon whom they deſign any advantage: ſo as they beleeve, they do their Prince a manifeſt injurie, if they do
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98085:19"/>
not in his name treat them uncivilly. But his Excellence being reſolved to teach them the dignity of his Character, ſtopt himſelf imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and turning to the <hi>Priſtaff,</hi> remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to him the incivility of his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, telling him in theſe words, That he had received great civilities till then, but that he could by no means give him that advantage, which was due to himſelf, That he was ſent from his Majeſtie of Great <hi>Britain</hi> to the Emperour, to do him all poſſible honour, but it was without derogating from himſelf, and much leſs from the King his Maſter. Thereupon <hi>Bogdan,</hi> in ſome perplexitie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed himſelf, by alledging the Orders he had received from the Governour to that purpoſe, and entreated his Excellence to make a little ſtay: In the mean time, he diſpatched away a Meſſenger to the Governour, to give him notice how unluckily his Deſign had ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and continued bare-headed all the while (till the meſſenger returned) though his Excellence was covered. At length the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was decided, to the advantage of the Ambaſſador, who was immediately conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Lodging, where the <hi>Priſtaff</hi> with great Apology, made him a liberal offer of all things neceſſary for his family.</p>
               <p>And this is all I have to ſay concerning the manner of our Entry. However, before I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98085:20"/>
the Circumſtances of our abode at <hi>Archangel,</hi> and the ſucceſs of our journey croſs the Country to <hi>Moſco,</hi> I think it not impertinent to give a Relation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try it ſelf, and the Inhabitants; to the end that the Readers, being pre-inſtructed in theſe two points, the manner of our Voyage may be more eaſily comprehended.</p>

                  <hi>Moſcovie</hi> is properly but the name of a Province ſo called, of which <hi>Moſco</hi> is the chief City. But as <hi>France</hi> communicates its name to all the Provinces under that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, ſo by <hi>Moſcovie</hi> are ordinarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all the Provinces united under the Obedience of the <hi>Czar.</hi> This Country is a part of the <hi>Europaean Sarmatia,</hi> whereof the Antients make mention; which is otherwiſe called <hi>Ruſſia</hi> or <hi>Roxolania,</hi> and from thence comes the name of <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> which is given to the <hi>Moſcovites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Empire which is doubtleſs the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all <hi>Europe,</hi> extends it ſelf Northward to the frozen Sea, beyond the <hi>Artique</hi> Circle; Eaſtward it is terminated by the River <hi>Oby;</hi> Southwards by the <hi>Crim Tartars</hi> and <hi>Precopia;</hi> And on the Weſt by <hi>Livonia, Poland,</hi> and <hi>Swedland.</hi> So that in its whole extent, as well
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98085:20"/>
in <hi>Aſia</hi> as <hi>Europe,</hi> it comprehends thirty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which is near ſix hundred leagues; and in its Latitude ſixteen, which is above three hundred.</p>
               <p>This Country is generally flat, in which Nature has taken delight, as it were, to put the Trees in aray, and to beautifie it with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lakes and Rivers. And in truth, <hi>Moſcovie</hi> from one end to the other, is in a manner no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a continual Foreſt, irrigated by ſeveral Lakes and Rivers, which render it incomparably pleaſant and beautiful. Amongſt others, there is <hi>Volga,</hi> ſometimes called <hi>Rha,</hi> and which the <hi>Tartars</hi> at preſent call <hi>Edel,</hi> without exception the fineſt River in <hi>Europe.</hi> It takes its ſource in the Province of <hi>Roſcovie,</hi> from a Lake called <hi>Fronow,</hi> and paſſing ſome few leagues beyond into another called <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> it takes its name from that Lake, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbogues near <hi>Aſtracan</hi> into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, Where it divides <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> So as from its head, to the place where it falls into the <hi>Caſpian,</hi> is a tract of a thouſand leagues at leaſt, receiving moſt of the Rivers in <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> as it goes along, which inlarge it ſo, that, as <hi>Olearius</hi> mentions in his Relation, it is not far from <hi>Nice,</hi> four thouſand ſix hundred Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical feet broad.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Boriſthenes</hi> alſo, which parts <hi>Lituania</hi> and <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> is very conſiderable; which riſeth in <hi>Roſcovie</hi> alſo, and diſchargeth it ſelf
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98085:21"/>
into the <hi>Euxin</hi> Sea. Beſides theſe, there is <hi>Duina</hi> which receiveth the <hi>Conſlans, Jagel,</hi> and <hi>Sucagna,</hi> and caſts it ſelf into the <hi>White</hi> Sea, ſome ſix or ſeaven leagues from <hi>Archangel.</hi> There is another <hi>Duina</hi> alſo, which riſeth ſome leagues off of the <hi>Nieper</hi> or <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> in a Lake that gives it its name, and falls into the <hi>Baltique</hi> about four leagues from <hi>Riga.</hi> The <hi>Oby,</hi> which diſcharges it ſelf into the <hi>Frozen</hi> Sea, and takes its ſource from the Lake <hi>Cataiſco,</hi> is ſo broad at the mouth, they muſt have a very good wind that croſs it in a day. I could ſpeak alſo of <hi>Moſca</hi> and <hi>Occa,</hi> conſiderable Rivers, and of ſeveral others this Country is well provided with; but it ſhall be ſufficient at preſent to ſay, that for the moſt part they loſe themſelves in the Rivers above-named. Beſides theſe, there is ſo great a number of Brooks, Pools, and Lakes, one can ſcarce paſs four or five leagues without ſeeing ſome great collection of Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſcovie</hi> being ſcituat in ſo cold a Climat, no wonder if the Winters be very long there, and the Froſts exceeding violent, eſpecially in the moſt Northerly Provinces. About <hi>Moſco,</hi> where the weather is more temperate, the Winter takes not up above ſix or ſeven moneths in the year: but on the Eaſtern, and Northern ſides of the Country, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the Province of <hi>Petzora,</hi> that runs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98085:21"/>
along by the <hi>Frozen</hi> Sea, their Winters are ſo long, that their Rivers which begin to thaw but in <hi>May,</hi> freez again before <hi>Auguſt</hi> is paſt. And although thoſe Provinces towards the South ſhould ſeem in reaſon to be more mild, they are notwithſtanding ſo ſubject to violent Cold, that one ſhall meet with men upon the Road benum'd ordinarily, who (though their whole body perhaps be not ſtupified) yet there is nothing more common, if they have not extraordinary care, than to have their Eares, their Lips, their Hands, or their Noſes frozen. In ſhort, the Colds there are great to that degree, that they many times become inſuperable by any exerciſe of the body, and cleave the very Earth as much as a Drought. The Rivers, the Lakes, the Sea it felt is frozen, and as at that time they ſeem to have changed their Natures, they change alſo their Cuſtomes. One may ſee there a River ſo frozen in four and twenty hours, that one may paſs over dry foot, and without doubt the abundance of Water that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the Froſt, muſt needs make the Aire more bitter, and the Winter more fierce.</p>
               <p>From thence it comes to paſs, that <hi>Moſcovie</hi> is exempt from Epidemical diſeaſes, their bodies being more robuſt, and more vigorous than in the hot Countries, where they are more ſubject to diſtempers. True it is, the Heats in the Summer are ſo exceſſive, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98085:22"/>
(as it is commonly reported in that Country) even the Fir-trees are ſometimes ſet on fire by the Sun. Nevertheleſs, the Nights are ſo freſh and coole, that in the moneth of <hi>July,</hi> we had Froſts, though the Days had been ſweltry and inſupportable. But that which is much more troubleſome than the Heat, is the Clouds of Inſects, of Waſps, and other Flies, ingendred by the Sun in the Pooles and Marſhes, which give a perpetual perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that travel.</p>
               <p>For Aliment, neceſſary for the ſubſiſtence of Man, <hi>Moſcovie</hi> produces ſo good, and in that quantity, that it yeelds not to the beſt country in <hi>Europe.</hi> They have Graſs and Corn in that abundance, that they know not which way to conſume it, for which cauſe here it is the <hi>Hollander</hi> makes his proviſion of corn yearly. Their Seed time is not before <hi>May,</hi> though about <hi>Moſco</hi> and the Provinces adjacent, the fields are open ordinarily in <hi>April,</hi> or the end of <hi>March:</hi> The great Froſts they have in the Winter, make them give the Earth more leiſure to thaw, yet that hinders not but they have their Harveſt before <hi>Auguſt.</hi> For the great heat of the Day, which is eighteen hours long, and the freſhneſs of the Night, which with plentiful dews waters the Corn, thruſts it up immediately, and in a ſhort time brings it to maturity. They have very good Beef, but their Mutton (eſpecially about <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel</hi>)
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98085:22"/>
is but indifferent. They have great ſtore of Deer, Wild-bores, and Elkes, but principally of Hares, which are gray all Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and in Winter as white as Snow: Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, Partridges, Wood-pigeons, Wood-cocks, Duck, and Mallard, Geeſe, Quailes, and Pigeons are very plentiful, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence cheap. Their Forreſts are well furniſhed with ſmall Birds alſo, as Thruſhes, Larkes, and Feldifere; but having enough of others, they do not ſpend their time in taking of them. There are alſo about <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel</hi> ſome Birds of prey white all over. And if the Forreſts befriend them with ſuch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Game, their Rivers, Lakes, and Pools are no leſs bountiful in their Fiſh: In the <hi>Volga,</hi> they have a kind of Sturgeon, of whoſe Eggs they make an excellent Ragout, which they call <hi>Ikari,</hi> and the <hi>Italians Cavayar,</hi> which affords a conſiderable Trade in thoſe Parts, and the Czar keeps it to himſelf: They put their Eggs into Paſte, and (having prepared them with Salt ten or twelve days) they eat them like a Sallad with Vinegar, oyl of Olives, Pepper, and Onions, They have all kind of Pulſe, and Pot-hearbs, yet it is not long ſince Sallades and Aſparagas were in faſhion in <hi>Moſco;</hi> and ſince Flowers and ſtrong Hearbs were tranſplanted thither. Onions and Garlick are ſo common amongſt them, eſpecially in their Lents, that one needs
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98085:23"/>
go no further than his Noſe for information. They have great quantities of Melons, Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and Gourds, and we were aſſured, that (like thoſe which <hi>Olearius</hi> mentions of the figure of a Lamb) they change their place as they grow, that they dry up the Graſs which way ſoever they turn, and that when ripe, the ſtock dies, and that the fruit being covered with a certain velvet on the rinde, the ſame with a little preparation is made ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable as Furrs. And theſe kind of Gourds are frequently had near <hi>Samara,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Volga</hi> and the <hi>Doa.</hi> They have no want of Apples, Plums, or Cherries, but they have no Walnut-trees, or ſuch Fruit as require a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more moderate heat. They have good ſtore of fair Straw-berries, and in <hi>Autumn</hi> a certain red Gooſ-berry, that grows flat upon the ground. They have Mulberries alſo, and Raſberries, and Honey in that abundance, that they gather it as they paſs along the Woods. All which being conſidered together, with their vaſt numbers of Cattle, one may well ſay, That this alſo is a Countrey flowing with Milk and Honey. Of this Honey they make a great proportion of Wax, ſo as beſide what they conſume in their Torches, Candles, and Lamps, they utter yearly near twenty thouſand Quintals to Strangers. Of this Honey it is they make their Mead, which they call <hi>Mioude,</hi> a very common drink amongſt them. They
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98085:23"/>
make it of raw Honey, beaten in warm water, which, when they have ſtirred up and down a long time with a ſtick, they cover, and let it ſtand twelve hours: then boyling and ſcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, they ſtrain it thorow a cloath, and it is made. They have alſo another ſort that is red, which is excellent with Straw-berries, Cherries, Mulberries, or Raſps, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with more curioſitie and ingredients. Beſides this, the Ordinary People drink <hi>Quaz,</hi> which is a kind of ſmall Beer, and not unpleaſant. The better Sort make themſelves a kind of ſtrong Beer, which they keep in their Snow-houſes all the Summer. True it is, they have no Vines, yet by the Courteſie of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollander,</hi> they are every year ſo well provided with Wine and ſtrong Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they have no want either of the one or the other.</p>
               <p>Stone being a Rarity in <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> and Wood ſo plentiful, there are few Houſes but what are built of Wood; which I obſerved to have two conveniences: One is, that they are warmer than Stone, the Other, that they are cheaper. But withal, they have this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, that they are more obnoxious to the Element of Fire, which is ſo outragious ſometimes, that it devoures a whole Town at a blow. And hence it is their Houſes are very rude, without any faſhion or art, being only ſo many pieces of Firr piled up one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98085:24"/>
another, and Moſs ſtuft in betwixt them, their Windows very ſmall, and their Roofs of bark of Trees, covered over ſometimes with Turf. So that (their Stoves excepted, which they uſe to warm their Chambers with, in the ſeverity of the Winter) they do almoſt follow the Diſcipline of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> who would have the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> build with no other Inſtruments, than the Hatchet and Saw. They are generally low, and thoſe of the Peſants, not of above one or two Rooms at the moſt, in which the Father, Mother, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Hogs, and Hens lie all together. They have for the moſt part no Chimneys, inſomuch as when they make uſe of their Stoves, the ſmoak goes out ſtill at the Windows. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Remedy the <hi>Muſcovits</hi> have againſt the miſchief of fire, is the miſerable furniture of their Houſes, which is ſo contemptible, that in any ſuch accident, they can loſe nothing with their Lodgings, but their Diſhes and Spoons, which are made of Earth or Wood; ſo that they comfort themſelves in their loſſes, by the facility of their Reparations.</p>
               <p>For their Garments, which are very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the reſiſtance of the Winter, Nature muſt be acknowledged to have dealt very prudently in providing their Foreſts, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with Beaſts of prey, with whoſe Skins they protect themſelves againſt the injuries of the Weather. For, beſides Furs of Otters,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98085:24"/>
Martins, common Foxes, and Hares; they have ſome more precious, as your black Fox, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Beaver, Ermines, and gray Squirrels. They have white Bears alſo, whoſe Skin is of great value, and much uſed by great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to hang behind the back of their Sledges, as an Ornament, when they travel or paſs thorow the Town. The Skins of the common Bears are of much uſe to the ſame purpoſe, which beaſts are there in ſo great numbers, that they do not only infeſt the High-waies in Winter and make them dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, but trooping together in Companies, they ſometimes fall upon a whole Village, and deſtroy it. Their Wolves are no leſs fierce, and ſometimes they have much ado to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves againſt them; They have white Wolves too, but not ſo frequent. They have a water Rat, whoſe skin is of a pleaſant Smell, and very proper to lay amongſt cloaths.</p>
               <p>They have Hemp and Flax in that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> that notwithſtanding all that is exported from <hi>Archangel,</hi> linnen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them is very cheap. It is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that I mention the Leather of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> being a thing ſo well known already in <hi>Europe</hi> by the means of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollander,</hi> who tranſport it dayly from <hi>Archangel.</hi> Cloth is the only thing that is defective to the <hi>Muſcovits,</hi> what they make there being courſe and thick, and for the uſe only of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98085:25"/>
Peaſants; which gives occaſion to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> to drive a great Trade there every year with that Commodity.</p>
               <p>As for Travailing, they have great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages (eſpecially in the Winter) by their Sledges. For the Country being flat and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Cold, and the ground at that time covered conſtantly with Snow, their Sledges which are drawn with horſes glide eaſily away upon the ſurface of it, and paſs with incredible ſwiftneſs. Theſe Sledges are made of the Bark of the Linden-tree, about the length of a man, in which one lies along. They line them commonly with ſome thick Felt to make them warm, and becauſe the top is open, they cover and wrap themſelves up in good Furs, as well as they can. They travail under the conduct of a Carter, who ſits on one ſide, and ſometimes by fits will endeavour to warm himſelf with running by, but moſt commonly with good full draughts of ſtrong Water, which is his principal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative in his Travels. And if at any time he happens to overturn upon any Bank or Declivity, the Sledge being built low, the fall is the leſs dangerous. The Ladies Sledges, that are covered above and on all ſides like Coaches, are built much higher, and by conſequence much heavier, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more dangerous, otherwiſe they ſlide along upon the Snow like the reſt. This
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98085:25"/>
manner of Travailing in Sledges, is not only convenient (ſeeing one may in three dayes time travail in them from <hi>Vologda</hi> to <hi>Moſco,</hi> which is at leaſt an hundred leagues diſtance) but pleaſant alſo in ſo plain a Country. And (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a man be well covered) he may ſleep with eaſe, his motion is light and inſenſible, and favours rather, than diſturbs ones repoſe: beſides the Advantage of Travailing by nights, as well as by days, according to the importance of occaſions. In Summer they have two waies of Travailing, by Land, and by water, whereas in Winter they Travail but only by Land. On the firſt, one may tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on Horſe-back, by Coach, or by Waggon, the Ways being very broad, beautiful, and generally eaſie for Travail all <hi>Moſcovie</hi> tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. In the other way of Travailing, they make uſe of certain little Boats, made all of one piece, of the trunk of a Tree made hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in which they ſtand right up, and row over Lakes and Rivers. So, theſe Boats being very light, a man with ſmall care can travail a great way in a very ſhort time. But there is this dangerous inconvenience in them, if there be not an exact counterpoiſe obſerved, they totter from one ſide to another, till at laſt they turn quite over. They make uſe alſo of certain floting Bridges, made of pieces of Firr joined and tyed together, which bear themſelves up upon the Water. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98085:26"/>
they have this great incommodity in all ſorts of Travailing, that they have no Inns or Houſes of Reception to retire to, or where one may be accommodated, as in other Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo that one muſt carry both his Bed and Proviſion along with him. And for this reaſon the Merchants that traffique from <hi>Archangel</hi> to <hi>Moſco</hi> have their houſes at <hi>Vologda</hi> and <hi>Moſco,</hi> and being well known and accommodated, it is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to travail with them. Another great incommodity in the Summer is the violence of the Heat, and the importunity of the Flies, buzzing perpetually about ones Face, and interrupting the pleaſure one might take in the beauty of the Foreſts, and the grateful confuſion of Light, and Shadow that is made in the Woods.</p>
               <p>Thus far we have repreſented the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Country, we will now conſider the Genius of the People ſuccinctly; and that Firſt, In reſpect of their Origine, their Stature, their Habits, and Language; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Of their Humour, and Nature, and Diſpoſition; Thirdly, Of their Managery, and manner of Living; Fourthly, Of their Policy; and Laſt of all, Of their Religion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moſcovits,</hi> or <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> are thoſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98085:26"/>
whom the Antients called <hi>Rhoxalani,</hi> they boaſt themſelves deſcended from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whom in many things they zealouſly imitate. But this I dare undertake, they are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the <hi>Lacedaemonians;</hi> If they be, they have left all their Vertue behind them. I ſhould rather deduce them from thoſe, who were called <hi>Sibarites,</hi> who had the Reputation of good Drinkers above all others.</p>
               <p>Their Shape and Proportion is much the ſame with the <hi>Germans,</hi> being for the moſt part Corpulent, and of a ſtrong Complexion. The <hi>Boyars</hi> (for ſo their principal Nobility are termed) are very ambitious to have their bellies ſtick out, as if they eſteemed it a mark of their Nobility. Great Beards (as in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>) are in great requeſt here alſo, and lookt upon as tokens of Virility, and he that hath the greater Beard, is the braveſt man amongſt them. But though they wear their Beards ſo long, yet they pleaſe themſelves as much in the ſhortneſs of their Hair, which they cut very cloſe, notwithſtanding the Coldneſs of the Country. Eccleſiaſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only wear long Hair, except ſuch Lords of the Court as are in diſgrace with the <hi>Czar,</hi> who as a teſtimony of their affliction do ſuffer it careleſly to hang down over their Shoulders; Not unlike the antient Cuſtome among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> upon any publique or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98085:27"/>
Calamity. For then the Women ſhaved their Heads, and the Men wore their Hair at length; whereas commonly they did the contrary. The Women in <hi>Moſcovie</hi> are of a midling Stature, and well proportioned, they are for the moſt part handſom, and well featured; but painting is amongſt them ſo common, they never think themſelves beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful without it. And whereas other Women uſe it as a concealment of their deformity, theſe for the moſt part do uſe it (how groſs or bad ſoever it be) as a Veil to their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The married Women have a Cuſtome of putting up their Haires in a Coyfe, whereas their Virgins ſuffer it to hang down in two Treſſes upon their Backs.</p>
               <p>As to their Habits, the Men wear long great Robes down to their Feet, not much unlike the <hi>Greeks,</hi> with ſleeves of the ſame length, but very ſtrait, in ſo much as when they dreſs themſelves, they muſt turn them up in ſeveral plates upon their Armes, and in that multitude of folds they fancy there is great comlineſs. They have two conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences by the length of their ſleeves; one, that in the Winter time they do the office of a Muff, whilſt having no imployment for their hands, they let them hang down at their full length. The other is, that when they have any deſign to rob, or take revenge upon any body, they let them hang down as for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98085:27"/>
warmth; and under that pretence they carry their cudgels, ſtones, or daggers in them. They ordinarily wear them as low as their knucles, and ſo they have but one half of their hands at liberty. The moſt conſiderable Perſons amongſt them make their robes of Sattin, Damask, or cloth of Gold: The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, of cloth of a dusky, violet, or dark green colour, and ſometimes of red: The People of the loweſt Condition have theirs of a dark-coloured courſe Cloth, made in their own Country. In Winter every one lines them with Fur, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral qualities, the poor People generally lining theirs with Sheep skins, which though they be very uſeful againſt the Extremity of the weather, yet in this they are inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that they caſt an ill ſmell, and are in perpetual hoſtility with our Noſes. They wear Juſte-au-corps or Veſts alſo, which are made cloſe to their Body, and come down to the Calf of their Legs, open before, and ſet to the bottom with Gold or Silver buttons, and having Collars very large. Under them, they have ſtrait Breeches, and Waſt-coats (which they call <hi>Caftan</hi>) that come down to their knees, whoſe Collars are made after the faſhion of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> only theſe are much higher, ſo that they go round about the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of their Heads. They are generally made of Sattin, Damask, or Taffaty, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98085:28"/>
theſe Collars, by reaſon of their heighth, are very conſpicuous, they line them many times with Velvet, or cloth of Gold, and ſometimes adorn them with Pearls and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones. Nor doth this vanity reſt here, it goes even to their Shirts, which the richeſt ſort Embroider at the Collar, Wriſts, and Breaſt, with ſeveral coloured Silk, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with Jewels or Gold. They wear no Hats, only a Bonnet of cloth, with a little ſnip open before and behind, which hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the form of a Pyramide. The Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have them of Scarlet cloth, or Velvet embroidered with Pearl on the ſides, and in Winter time lined with the preciouſeſt Furs; but the common Sort wear nothing but white Felt or cloth Caps, which they get lined in Winter with the vileſt ſort of Fur. Cloath is ſo dear in that Country, that many amongſt them make no bones of patching up their Bonnets with pieces and ſhreds of ſundry colours, ſo that they reſemble in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the diſguiſed Water-men in the Play. Theſe Bonnets I obſerved to be altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient abroad; for having no brims, they give no protection againſt the Sun, the Wind, the Rain, or the Snow: whereas our Hats are ſome defence to us in all theſe caſes. The <hi>Polonian</hi> Bonnets are more commodious than theſe; for they are made with a brim of paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, of each ſide covered over with Fur:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98085:28"/>
and hence it is, that in Winter moſt Strangers make uſe of them in <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> as being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer than our hats. In ſtead of Shoes, the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> wear commonly Boots without ſtops, which ſerve them alſo for Pockets: the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants wear ſhoes made of the bark of a Tree wrought very thin, and interwoven and braided, after the manner of Wicker baskets. The moſt of them have no Stockins, only ſome peeces of Fur or cloth wrapt about their Legs, and tied faſt with a pack-thred. There is no great difference betwixt the Mens Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and the Womens, ſaving that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Robes are ſomewhat larger, and their Sleeves not ſo faſtned to the bodies of their Robes, but that they can either put them on, or let them hang by as they pleaſe. They have this onely peculiar in their ſmock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleeves, that they are commonly three or four Ells long, plated into ſo many folds, that they have nothing elſe from the top of their Arm to their Fingers end. But their greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is in their Bonnets, which for the Women, are made a very fantaſtical way.</p>
               <p>Their Language hath great affinity with the <hi>Slavonian,</hi> as well as the <hi>Polonian,</hi> ſo that he who underſtands either of theſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be at any great loſs for the <hi>Moſcovian,</hi> which is pleaſant enough, and not very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to learn. They have borrowed their Characters from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but have ſince
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98085:29"/>
much altered and transformed them, and they abound ſo much in double Letters, that they have increaſed their Alphabet to the number of forty. But their Character is that alone wherein they communicate with the <hi>Greek;</hi> for their Words have very little affinity to it.</p>
               <p>And thus I have given an account of their Original, their Stature, their Habits, and their Language; we will now proceed to their Nature and Genius.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moſcovites</hi> (as appears particularly by their Commerce) are a People of great Wit, Cunning, and Dexterity.</p>
               <p>They are of a Temper very remarkable in this, that they are ſo accuſtomed to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of Heat and Cold, that the ſuddeneſt and moſt violent alteration that can be, makes no ill impreſſion on their health. There one may ſee little Children come running out of their warm Stoves in their ſhirts in the midſt of Winter, and having (in the fierceſt Cold imaginable) taken two or three frisks upon the Snow, return immediately into their Stoves, and find no inconvenience by the change. Inſomuch, that as <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> had but one Habit Winter and Summer; ſo do theſe ſeem to have but one Temper; neither the Heat ſucceeding the Cold, nor the Cold the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98085:29"/>
Heat, making any alteration in them. In ſhort, they are ſo hardned and accuſtomed to both Heat and Cold, that their Cuſtome ſeems to be turned into Nature. Beſides, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed to very hard fare, and brought up as they are in ſervitude and ſlavery, they muſt unqueſtionably be very proper for the Wars. And indeed having little comfort or pleaſure in their lives, they want rather Conduct than Courage to fight. Nevertheleſs, Idleneſs which in other places is reckoned as the Root of all Vices, ſeems to be peculiar to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo Lazy are they naturally, and of ſuch Antipathy to all kind of Labour. It muſt be either force or neceſſity that compels them thereunto, they often preferring a baſtinado or whipping before an honeſt but painful imployment.</p>
               <p>From hence it is, that Drunkenneſs amongſt them is ſo familiar, that there are but few Perſons exempt from it. The Clergy are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to it, as well as the Laity, the Women as the Men, the Young as the Old, all ſtriving as it were, with a brutiſh emulation to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drink one another. <hi>Aquavitae</hi> is generally the charm by which this Metamorphoſis is made, like the liquour of <hi>Circe,</hi> which turns them into Swine; or like the Mead of <hi>Camma</hi> which carries death along with it, when they venture ſo far as to dye upon the ſpot. Yet I muſt ſay, that notwithſtanding this liquor
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98085:30"/>
is very neceſſary in this Country, and that there were ſcarce any living without it, in regard it is a ſovereign Remedy againſt the Cold, and not un-uſeful in Summer. But the abuſe of it is grown ſo great, that, inſtead of taking it now and then for the re-inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Spirits, they imploy it to their diſſolution; and whereas by a moderate ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, it would be a means of refreſhment, their debauches pervert its good effects, and turn it to their ruin. Tobacco was formerly alſo taken with no leſs extravagancy than their ſtrong Water now, but in the year 1634 the <hi>Czar</hi> and Patriarch thought good with great rigour to prohibit it, many of them having before that time ſet their Houſes on fire by their negligence, when they were drunk with Tobacco. The poore People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of buying themſelves bread, conſumed all their Money in Tobacco. Beſides (which was the particular diſguſt of the Patriarch) they preſented themſelves before their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with ſo reeking and ſmoaky a breath, that, perhaps he was afraid, they would poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon their Saints, with the ſtink of their To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco. At this day it is more frequently uſed than in ſome years paſt, the ſearch being not now ſo ſtrict againſt the takers, nor the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſo ſeverely inflicted on them that ſell it. Strangers have the liberty to uſe it, which makes the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> to be the more
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98085:30"/>
deſirous of it, for ſome of them would almoſt worſhip a man for a pipe of Tobacco.</p>
               <p>But Vice having (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves) many baits and allurements, by the motion and repreſentation of which, it gives the Paſſions ſeveral encroachments to entangle themſelves: So may I ſay of Drunkenneſs, that it hath its attraction, and draws men into Laſciviouſneſs and Exceſs. Amongſt the reſt of the World, the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> do furniſh us with experiments of this kind, both the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and the Men giving themſelves over to Ebriety, there is a concomitant addiction to Wantonneſs. True it is, the <hi>Czar</hi> permits not any publick Brothels, but the Drunkenneſs and Idleneſs wherewith this Country is exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively delighted, is the occaſion of ſo great irregularity, that Sodomie it ſelf is no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to it.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Quaeritur Aegyſthus quare ſit factus adulter,</l>
                  <l>In promptu cauſa eſt deſidioſus erat.</l> 
                  <bibl>Ovid.</bibl>
               </q>
               <p>Upon this ſcore the Inſolencies they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in their ordinary Quarrels are inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Upon all occaſions they make no ſcruple of upbraiding one another with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, Sodomie, and ſuch crimes, as the very thought of them ought to be horrid and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, Civility and Complacence amongſt them is ſo rare, tis no wonder if they be very
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98085:31"/>
ſparing of it before Strangers: to whom if they bear any difference or reſpect, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly from ſome advantage they expect to draw from them. And in that caſe they ſpare not their Caps, and the greateſt reverence they can ſhow, which is commonly expreſſed by a low declination of their Head towards the ground without moving a Foot. The Women uſe alſo the ſame way of ſaluting one another, only they bow themſelves more gradually, and letting their hands hang looſe by their ſides, they touch not their Bonnets at all. But when a Citizen or Peaſant would ſhow ſomething more than ordinary Reſpect, then he goes to the very ground, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates himſelf, even to the beating the ground with his Forehead; which is the manner of expreſſing the Reverence which they bear to their Nobility. And this extreme ſubmiſſion is that which makes their Magiſtrates ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, and ſo exceeding jealous of their Authoritie, that Strangers let them be of what Quality they will, do very rarely meet with any Kindneſs or Civility amongſt them. And withall, having an opinion of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of their Emperour, that he is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably greater than any King in <hi>Europe,</hi> from thence it comes to paſs, that they uſe Ambaſſadors ſo indifferently, making no ſcruple to prefer themſelves before them; in which regard there is great prudence and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98085:31"/>
circumſpection required to the maintaining the Honour of ones Prince amongſt them.</p>
               <p>And this is in general a true Character of the Humour of the <hi>Ruſſians;</hi> it remains now that (according to the Order I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) I give ſome Proſpect of their manner of Living.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſcovie</hi> is indeed a very fertile and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Country, yet the Inhabitants brought up from their Cradles in great Hardſhip and Auſterity, underſtand not how to improve the advantages it yields. And being born as it were to Slaverie, they eaſily endure thoſe Incommodities, which without long accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation would have been intolerable. So that what <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſaid of the People of <hi>Aſia,</hi> may be very well applyed to them, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are very good Slaves, but would make the worſt Free-men in the World. For their Oeconomie and the affairs of their Houſes, it is certain, they are very ill furniſht, that they live very poorely, and that they know no ſuperfluity, but of Drink. Thoſe Perſons of Quality that are obliged to live in any Equipage or Heighth, have all their Proviſions from their own Farms. The common People have little other chear than Peas, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nops, Cabbages, Coleworts, and freſh Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98085:32"/>
or pickled with Salt and Vinegar. They have freſh Fiſh and Salt ſometimes: but then they never forget their Onyons and Garlick, which are their principal hautgout. Beſides theſe they have little other fare, eſpecially of Fleſh, moſt of their year being taken up by faſting days, and their Butter and Cheeſe is ſo bad, that it is a hard thing for Strangers to make uſe of them. Thoſe who are rich enough to have <hi>Aquavitae</hi> of their own, will not ſit down at the Table, till they have drank of it, and whilſt they are at Meales they drink it, and leſt their Digeſtion ſhould be weak, they muſt needs have their Dram too afterwards. The common People are alwaies prepared for it, as well drunk as ſober, at midnight as at noon-day; and though their Waters are made very ſtrong, yet for fear they ſhould not be hot enough, they clap in now and then a good quantity of Pepper. Their Ordinary drink is <hi>Mead</hi> and <hi>Quaz,</hi> as I have intimated before. After Dinner the <hi>Ruſſes</hi> have a Cuſtome of ſhutting up their Shops, and going to ſleep; and the great Perſons amongſt them, will ſcarce ſpeak of affaires with any Body. Nevertheleſs they uſe Beds ſo little, that none but ſome Perſons of quality do lye upon Beds or Quilts. The People of <hi>Capua</hi> had antiently a Cuſtome to ſuffer none of their Children to uſe any Beds, till they were married, becauſe as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98085:32"/>
Beds were not invented for young beardleſs Boys, but for antient and decrepit Men. Amongſt the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> this Cuſtome is more ſevere; for they uſe them neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor after they are married, nor in the very extremity of Age. In Winter time they content themſelves to lye along upon a table or a bench of Firr before their Stoves, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves only with their clothes: and for coolneſs in Summer they make bold with the Ground.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of Candles, the Peaſants make uſe of long and thin chips of Firr, which being very dry preſently take fire, and give a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One thing there is very commendable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> and that is, that the Women have great reſpect generally for their Husbands; for which reaſon they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly retired, and appear very ſeldome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that is, that ſhe ſhould appear when her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is by, and in his abſence keep her ſelf cloſe at home. <hi>Phidias</hi> making the Image of <hi>Venus</hi> for the <hi>Elians,</hi> repreſented her ſtanding upon a Tortoiſe; to ſignifie, that a Woman ſhould by no means be goſſipping abroad. It is to be commended alſo in the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> that they permit not their Wives to be ſeen too frequently in the Streets, though in other things their Diſcipline appears rigid enough, and favouring of too much ſeverity. For they make uſe of them only as a neceſſarie evil, they look upon them ſupercilliouſly, and with frownes, they beat them often, and handle them as if they were their ſlaves, and not part of themſelves.</p>
               <p>But if the Women in general are ſo retired, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Nobility, the Virgins are much more for beſides, that they appear very ſeldom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, when they do ſo they cover themſelves alwaies with a Vaile, to prevent their being ſeen: ſo that many times they marry before the Bride-groom hath ſeen his Miſtreſſes face Amongſt them it is not permitted that young Men and Maids ſee one another, nor that they make any promiſes of Marriage by Word o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Writing, thoſe things being alwaies left to the tranſaction of the Parents. So it ſometime happens that the Bridegroom, having not ſee his Wife till he be brought up into her cham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber where ſhe is laid, that the man who ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98085:33"/>
a very handſom Wife, meets with a deformed Perſon, and perhaps a counterfeit, if the Parents will but conſent to the Cheat. This Cuſtome of Womens wearing Vailes, is very antient, eſpecially amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who did it in token of Baſhfulneſs and Chaſtity, as the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> do now. And hence it was that <hi>Rebecca</hi> as ſoon as ſhe ſaw her Husband, took a Vail and covered herſelf, and that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> deceived <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he gave him <hi>Leah</hi> his Eldeſt daughter, who was bleer-eyed, inſtead of the Beautiful <hi>Rachel</hi> whom he had promiſed him.</p>
               <p>The Demeanour of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> being thus deſcribed, as to their manner of Living, we ſhall now ſpeak ſomewhat of the Baths, of which they make uſe in imitation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients. They are cloſe places with Furnaces, which they heat exceedingly, and for the greater excitation of Vapours, they caſt Cold water now and then upon the Stove. They have divers Benches, at ſome diſtance, one above another, which yield ſeveral degrees of Heat, according as each one thinks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. They lay themſelves along ſtark naked upon theſe Benches, and after they have ſwet a competent time by means of thoſe hot Vapours, that have diffuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all over the Bath, there is care taken, that their Bodies be well waſhed with Warm water, or ſome other liquour, and rubbed all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98085:34"/>
over with hand-fuls of Hearbs. After which they commonly take a Dram of the bottle, to re-inforce their Spirits, which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo weakened by their ſweating, that they fall into a ſwound. And theſe Baths are the univerſal Remedies the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> make uſe of, as well for keeping of their Bodies clean, as for conſervation of their Health, which they enjoy with great advantage above other Nations. And for this reaſon there is not a Town without its Stoves, both publique and private: which they believe very neceſſary for new married People, eſpecially after their firſt congreſs, therefore in ſuch a caſe, they alwaies make uſe of this kind of purification.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuch as every Country hath its divertiſements, as being neceſſary for the Exerciſe and Recreation of the Body, it is but reaſonable to ſay ſomething of thoſe that are in uſe amongſt the <hi>Moſcovites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At their Feſtivals, their young Men are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to meet in great numbers, and for their paſtime to play at fifty cuffs, or cudgels, without the leaſt quarrelling, or exceptions. By which means they are ſo inured to blows, that they become almoſt inſenſible, and have much greater averſion to work, than they have to the whip or the cudgel, though the ſame be laid on in very good earneſt. Some alſo there are that underſtand wreſtling pretty well, with which they exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98085:34"/>
in imitation of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who are taken to be very skilful in this kind of Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. In Winter they have a ſort of Pattins, or Scates, as they have in <hi>Holland,</hi> of which they make uſe, as ſoon as the Rivers are fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, not to make their journeys with (as in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>) but for their Exerciſe, and to warm themſelves upon the Ice. They are made of Wood, with a long peece of poliſhed Iron at the bottome, very ſtrait and turned upward at the toe, and that the Iron may the better cut the Ice, they turn their Feet, on the one ſide and the other, ſo that they go directly on very faſt. They have alſo publique Engins to Swing withal, like a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gallowes, having four places for four men, all in an equal diſtance, where having placed themſelves, they ſwing continually by the Counterpoiſe they give one another, ſo that while ſome ſwing up to the heighth of a Wind-mill, one may ſee the others falling near as low as the Ground: which they do ſucceſſively, till they think it fit to hold. The Women have Ropes which they ſwing with, or elſe they lay a plank croſs a block, and mounting one at one end, and the other at the other, they toſs themſelves up with a very violent motion. Their ordinary Muſique, is nothing but a bag pipe, which they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſometimes with the tune of a Song. They make ſo ill uſe of their Trumpets and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98085:35"/>
Kettle-Drums, that the ſame render but a harſh and obſtreperous Harmony; Their Howboys are much better, which they uſe before their Infantry in the Wars.</p>
               <p>As for their dancing, it is ſo abſurd and ridiculous, that the Bears they teach to dance there acquit themſelves better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For they tumble up and down in ſuch Brutiſh and unbecoming poſtures, one would think they uſe it onely to excite Laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereas this exerciſe ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and managed with decency as a thing that is very graceful and honourable. They uſe great diſtortions with their hands, ſhoulders, and back parts, and hopping right up with their feet, they ſcarce appear to move one ſtep out of their place.</p>
               <p>This being their manner of Living in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, we ſhall now give an accompt how they regulate themſelves in reſpect of the publick, by the Laws and Cuſtomes of their Country; and ſo having done with their Oeconomy, we ſhall proceed to their Policie, and after that to their Religion.</p>
               <p>Policie and Religion are the two Poles, on which the Globe of civil Societie moves. And though it is poſſible ſome places may be found very barbarous and licentious, where
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98085:35"/>
Learning and Civility were in no eſteem, and where the Government by Kings was not uſual, yet it is hard to name any place that hath ſubſiſted without ſome Policie or other, and where they have not had ſome ſenſe or apprehenſion of a Deitie. But amongſt all the Policies of the World, Monarchie is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly the moſt advantageous, as moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Majeſtie of God, who alone manages and preſides over the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. The State of <hi>Moſcovie</hi> which is now before us, is Monarchical: but it is alſo De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotical and Abſolute, inſomuch as the <hi>Tzar</hi> being Lord and Maſter (as it were) over all his Subjects, diſpoſeth uncontroulably of their lives and eſtates, as he thinks good. And under this kind of Monarchie it was they lived, which were antiently called <hi>Barbarians,</hi> as the <hi>Aſſyrians, Medes,</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> whoſe Princes uſurped that Magiſterial Authoritie over their Perſons and Goods, governing their Subjects no otherwiſe than as a Lord doth his ſlaves. And ſuch at this day is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in <hi>Turky,</hi> where the Grand Segniour hath ſo abſolute a Sovereignitie over his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that he diſpoſeth of their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, as an abſolute Lord. But for the better comprehenſion of the State of <hi>Moſcovie</hi> under the Domination of ſo unqueſtionable a Prince, it is Firſt to be conſidered, in what his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Authoritie conſiſts; Secondly the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98085:36"/>
Submiſſion, Obedience, and ſingular Reſpect his Subjects bear him; Thirdly the Policie and Order, by which his Dominion over his Subjects is maintained, and the union and concurrence of Obedience in his Subjects preſerved and eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tzars</hi> of <hi>Moſcovie</hi> having the Power and Right of diſpoſing of the Lives and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of their Subjects, in this vaſt Tract of ground under their Dominion, no queſtion but it is abſolute over all depending upon that Government. It is the <hi>Tzar</hi> alone that gives Laws to the People, it is he that diſpoſeth of the Government of the Provinces, it is he that ſends and receives Ambaſſadors, it is he that levies Impoſts and Taxes, and in ſhort, doth every thing that he pleaſes. And from hence it is he is called Grand Seigneur, and<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tzar,</hi> is the right pronuntiation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Ruſſes,</hi> therefore I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpell it ſo than <hi>Czar</hi> with a <hi>C,</hi> as it is commonly written, becauſe it ſeems to be derived from <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Tzar,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, King, or Emperour, elſe he is called <hi>Velika Knez,</hi> which ſignifies Great Duke. His Armes are an Eagle with two Heads, carrying three Crowns, which import <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, Caſan,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aſtracan,</hi> two Kingdoms he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes in <hi>Tartary.</hi> There is alſo in his Eſcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chion, a Cavalier repreſented in Combat with a Dragon, which without doubt muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel, or St. <hi>George.</hi> And as the Authoritie of this Prince,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98085:36"/>
muſt be acknowledged to be great, ſo his Revenues muſt be owned to be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and commenſurate. For beſides his proper Demains, which are very conſiderable, he hath an incredible Revenue from the Taverns, which he licenſeth thorow all his Dominions; beſides, five <hi>per</hi> Cent he exacts for all Merchandiſe imported or exported, and a vaſt Sum of Money he receives from the Factors he imployes himſelf. He hath a great Revenue alſo out of his Furs, and Cavyar, being a commodity he reſerves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to himſelf, he makes very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages by that alſo. Yet this I muſt needs ſay, that if his Treaſure be vaſt, his Iſſues and Expences are not ſmall, as well in reſpect of the Splendour and extraordinary Pompe he lives in, as the continual Wars he maintains with his Neighbors, either the <hi>Swedes,</hi> or the <hi>Polanders,</hi> or elſe the <hi>Tartars.</hi> For which reaſon he frequently raiſes: mighty Armies, and for his better Succeſs, gives great Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to his Officers, which are paid very punctually; and by this means he draws many Stangers to him, whoſe ſervice he likes very well, and knows which way to gratifie their Prudence and Fidelity. True it is, generally upon the commencement of a War, it is the People that ſupply him according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, by which he gives them ſeverely ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to underſtand the Power he hath over their fortunes and eſtates.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:98085:37"/>The greatneſs of this Prince being eſtabliſht in this manner, through the vaſt extent of his Dominion, by the abundance of his Wealth, the magnificence of his Court, and the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſſe and indiſputableneſſe of his power over all his Subjects; it is not to be doubted but the ſame imprints a moſt profound reſpect in the hearts of the people towards his Perſon. And indeed ſo abject are they, and ſubmiſſive to the Soveraigns command, that they will themſelves declare their own ſervitude, and caknowledg they hold their Eſtates from God and him only. Some would not refuſe any danger for his ſake, and would perhaps many times be over joy'd to expoſe their innocent lives at the Capriccio or fury of a Tyrant. They will freely confeſs to be his Slaves, and as a Teſtimony of their Humility, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver name themſelves in his preſence but with a diminutive, as if a Petitioners name be <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> he will ſay: <hi>I little Peter the humbleſt of all your Vaſſals do implore,</hi> &amp;c. They boaſt of nothing more than the ſparkling eyes of their Prince, (be he never ſo ſhore-ſighted as <hi>Dyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſius</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> was,) for they cry always, I have had the honor or ſhall have the honor to ſee the cleare eyes of our <hi>Tzar.</hi> And did not Chriſtian modeſty reſtrain them a little in the Religious reſpect they bear unto their Monarch, they would be near to fly out into ſuch Extravagant acclamations, as were uſed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98085:37"/>
to King <hi>Herod;</hi> and ſay of his voice, that it is the voice of a God, and not of a man. They are very careful alſo of inſinuating this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence into their Children, and of making them know the Majeſty of their Prince, before they are capable of underſtanding the miſery of their condition.</p>
               <p>And this diſcipline is principally founded upon three general Maximes; one of which is, That it is prohibited upon pain of death to any man to Travail out of that Country, unleſs they be the <hi>Tzars</hi> Merchants, or Miniſters of State, which he ſends to other Princes in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Ambaſſadors. The reaſon is, leſt by their Travails into other parts, they ſhould bring back ſome new cuſtomes at their return, and having taſted the ſweetneſs of the liberty other Nations injoy, they ſhould ſome time or other break aſunder the chains of their own Servitude. This maxime to us that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured with the happy liberty we are born under, might perhaps ſeem barbarous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, but the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> are ſo accuſtomed to this kind of Slavery, that they are ſcarce ſenſible of it, and do comfort themſelves in the vaſtneſs of their Country, which affords them ſpace enough for their Travails, and in the Examples of other Countries, which have lived, and do live under the ſame maxime. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> amongſt others, who glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and boaſted that they lived under the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98085:38"/>
greateſt liberty, were ſubject notwithſtanding to this Law, &amp; forbidden any Commerce with forreign Nations: Whereas the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are permitted to Traffick with them in their own Country. Which gives me ſome hopes they will in time leave off that ruſtick and barbarous humor, which is ſo natural to them, and learn by degrees to live with more civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for they are already delighted with the Converſation of forreign Merchants, and do pleaſe themſelves very much in their manner of living. And were they under a gentler Government, and had a free Trade with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body, no doubt but this Nation would in a ſhort time be taken with our civility and decent way of living. But this maxime that we do now diſcourſe of, has no leſs effect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the maintenance of their Religion, than their civil Cuſtomes, and is ſo exactly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the very Strangers themſelves that have entred into the ſervice of the <hi>Tzar,</hi> or have otherwiſe embraced their Religion, are not exempt from it. For to have made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſervant to the Great Duke, is to have made himſelf his Slave, and to have taken up his Religion, is to have abandoned his own Country, and to be always confined within the Limits of <hi>Muſcovie.</hi> In ſhort, by this Policy it may be eaſily imagined the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand little of Navigation, ſeeing they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it ſo little: and indeed they know no
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98085:38"/>
other Compaſs than the Earth, nor do any of them, except ſome few fiſher-men, expoſe themſelves to the Sea, and they no farther than within ſight of the Shore.</p>
               <p>The Second Maxime the <hi>Tzars</hi> make uſe of, for maintaining the Policie of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is, That they marry no forreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, nor look out any farher for a Wife, than their own proper Slaves. The other Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> who are ſolicitous of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the good and happineſs of their Subjects, do comport themſelves cleer other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; they marry themſelves with forreign Ladies for the Alliance of their Nations, and in order to eſtabliſh a reciprocal and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Amitie betwixt them, for the benefit of both. By which means they avoid the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their Wives Relations, which is almoſt inevitable, where a Prince takes a Wife out of his own Subjects. Moreover, it is certainly more honourable and more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Majeſtie of a King, to eſpouſe a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that is not of the number of his Subjects, uniting and mingling, as it were, their Crowns as well as their blood to produce a Poſterity perfectly Royal. Whereas to take a Wife from that infinite diſtance, which there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a King and a Subject, to join her to the Crown, to deſcend from his Throne, as it were, to raiſe her up thither, who perhaps is very unfit for ſo great an elevation, is no leſs
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98085:39"/>
than to proſtitute and debaſe the Majeſtie of a Monarch. Yet amongſt the <hi>Tzars</hi> of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> it is very uſual, leſt by introducing a foreign Princeſs ſhe ſhould bring ſome new Cuſtomes along with her, which in time might cauſe ſome alteration in the State. And from hence it was, that this preſent <hi>Tzar</hi> vouchſafed on Shrove-Sunday 1647. (which was then the ſeventeenth year of his Age and the ſecond of his Reign) to marry the eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Ilia-Danilovitz Miloſlausky,</hi> a perſon at that time in no excellent Condition; for to ſpeak properly, there was nothing but the Beauty of his Daughter to induce the <hi>Tzar</hi> to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him with ſo great a Relation.</p>
               <p>The Third Maxime by which their Policie and Religion is preſerved, is their Ignorance of Learning, which is ſo well eſtabliſhed in this Country, that they never learn farther than to write and read their own Language. And indeed Experience doth teach us this truth, that Seditions and Revolutions have not been any where ſo frequent as in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, where Learning was commonly in great eſteem, and even when it triumphed moſt. The reaſon of which is plain, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Ambition and Pride march alwaies in the Rear of great Knowledge: whereas Ignorance (as is evident amongſt the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants and common People every where) renders them more ſupple and obedient: And
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98085:39"/>
this <hi>Valentian</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> Emperors of <hi>Rome</hi> had experience of, when they termed Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Plague and Poiſon of a Kingdom. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was not far from this opinion, when he eſtabliſht Ignorance in his Republique. And we ſee at this day the greateſt Enemy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom triumphing, partly by vertue of this Maxime, over all the Monarchs of this Age. The <hi>Tzars</hi> of <hi>Muſcovie</hi> alſo find great benefit by this Policy, which conduces much to the eaſie Conſervation of Obedience in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects towards their Soveraign Empire. So that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have this advantage, that they quietly enjoy their apprehenſions of Nature, as they are at firſt ſight repreſented to their ſenſe, or their reaſons, without any ſcandalous Imputation of Ignorance. They do not trouble themſelves with the heighth of the Heavens, nor the greatneſs of the Earth, whether the Sun (as <hi>Anaximenes</hi> thought) be as flat as a Trencher, or whether it be hunch backed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath like a Cockboat, as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> held, or whether it be round or ſquare. They di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb not their heads with the dimenſions of the Moon, to know whether ſhe be hung looſe in the Air, or inhabited or not, whether the Stars be but Earth Muminated as <hi>Thales</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or whether perfect fire as <hi>Plato.</hi> They leave Nature to it ſelf, and think it ſufficient to know who is its Author, to diſcover the uſe of things by experience, and to give God
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98085:40"/>
thanks as they are able. They amuſe not themſelves to make Syllogiſmes, after the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of <hi>Barbara</hi> or of <hi>Feſtino,</hi> to diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Logick</hi> be an <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Science,</hi> nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine ſundry other curious and impertinent queſtions, which though of no uſe but to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and torture the brain, are yet at this day amongſt the learned people, in great practice and uſe, upon a meer principle of Curioſity, Ambition, or Intereſt. In ſtead of Books the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> uſe Rolls of Paper as the Jews did ſometimes; they glue every leaf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ends, with a certain Glue they have out of <hi>Siberia</hi> a Province of the <hi>Tzars,</hi> which they moiſten only with the end of their tongue, and drawing it upon the Edges of the two leaves they are to joyn, they put the Edges upon one another, which faſten ſo cloſe, it is ſcarce perceivable where they are joyned, and in this manner they make Rolls ſometimes of ſeven or eight Fathoms long.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, amongſt the Magiſtrates that Govern <hi>Muſcovie</hi> in their Councel of State, there are in the firſt place thirty Noblemen or Boiars, ſo properly called which the <hi>Tzar</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be Reſident in <hi>Moſco.</hi> After them there be the<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ockolnitz,</hi> that is to ſay a Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor.</note> 
                  <hi>Ockolnitz,</hi> the<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dumeny Duorainy</hi> ſignifies the ſame Office but in lower degree.</note> 
                  <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meny Duorainy,</hi> the <hi>Sin Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arsky,</hi> the Chancellor &amp; two Secretaries of State. There are ſix appartements in the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98085:40"/>
Councel of the Great Duke, the firſt is deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for forraign affairs, the ſecond for Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, the third for the Exchequer and the Treaſury of the <hi>Tzar,</hi> the fourth for receiving the Accounts of his Factors, and ſuch as have the Superintendance of the Taverns, the fifth for Civil Proceſſes, and the ſixth for Criminals. Their Councel is commonly held in the Night, and the <hi>Tzar</hi> changes the Governours of his Provinces every three Years.</p>
               <p>There is no room for ſubtilties or wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in this Country, they diſpatch their Suits in a ſhort time, according to the plainneſs and paucity of their Laws. So that the Atturneys and Sollicitors are there of as little uſe and concernment as the Philoſophers.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other puniſhments that they uſe, they have one they call <hi>Battoki,</hi> which has much affinity with that which God ordained in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> for the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as appears in the 25. Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> They ſtrip the condemned perſon to his Shirt, <hi>e. g.</hi> for having been the Author of ſome Riot, pilfering, or ſome other ſuch ſmall crime as is not worthy of death; Who then laying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf flat upon his Belly on the ground, there are two Men placed on each ſide of him, which give him as many blows with a Cudgel one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, as the Judge that preſides does condemn him to, ſixteen, twenty or thirty, more or leſs, according to the quality and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98085:41"/>
of the offence he has committed. And as ſoon as his accompt is made up, he riſes and makes his reverence to the perſon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him; Not much unlike the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who after correction returned, and gave their King thanks for his great Bounty in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring them. The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> uſe this kind of Chaſtiſement in their private Families alſo, eſpecially the Nobility, who have commonly great ſtore of Slaves, who without reſpect of their Society are oftentimes conſtrained to beat one another till the blood follows. They have another ſort of puniſhment with a Whip, which is much crueller, and inflicted by the hands of the Executioner, when the correction is publique. The Whip is made of the ſkin of an Elke cut into ſeveral thongs, which pierces the skin in ſuch manner, that at the very firſt laſh it oftentimes leaves bloody impreſſions behind it; their Capital puniſhment which they uſe commonly for thoſe that are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die, scutting off their heads, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort Evidences they uſe the <hi>Strapado.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for their Money, they have but one kind which they call <hi>Copeca,</hi> fifty of which make a Crown, 'tis of Silver, of an Oval figure, and ſo ſmall that the value of two Crowns will ſcarce bear the bulk of four pence in French Deniers; that which they call <hi>Muſcofske</hi> is the fourth part of a <hi>Copeca, Poluske</hi> is the half, an <hi>Alim</hi> is three pence, a <hi>Grifna</hi> is ten, a <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:98085:41"/>
a hundred, but theſe are not to be had of one piece.</p>
               <p>There are two things further remarquable in the commune Society of the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> one is that they begin their day at the riſing of the Sun, and end it at the ſetting, ſo that their Night begins as ſoon as the Sun is down, and ends when it riſes. By which means they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found that which we call the Natural day with the Artificial, which extends it ſelf from the riſing to the ſetting of the Sun. The other is, that they begin their Year the firſt day of <hi>September,</hi> as allowing no other Epoche than from the Creation of the World which they believe was in Autumn. And they reckon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> five thouſand five hundred and eight Years from the Creation of the World, to the Nativity of our Saviour, whereas we accompt but three thouſand nine hundred and ſixty nine. So that in the Year of our Lord 1663 when we arrived in <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> they reckoned 7175 Years from the Creation, whilſt we accounted but 5686. Every firſt day of the Year, they have great Proceſſions in their conſiderable Townes.</p>
               <p>And thus far we have given you the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98085:42"/>
or publique Comportment of the <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi> in the World: I ſhall now give you ſome hints of their Religion.</p>
               <p>The Religion of the <hi>Ruſſes</hi> is the ſame with the Profeſſion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they follow their Faith, their Rites, and their Ceremonies. The principal part of their Devotion after they are Baptized, conſiſts in the Invocation of their Saints. For every Family hath its Saint pictured, and hung up againſt the wall of the Chamber, with a ſmall wax Candle before it, which they light when they make their Invocations. Their Churches alſo are all adorned with Pictures, very ill drawn, and in flat painting; for they will endure no b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ages emboſt. Over the Porch of their Churches, in their Market places, and over the Gates of their Cities, they have alwaies the picture of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or their Patron St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi> And amongſt them theſe Images are in ſuch Veneration, that all that paſs that way make a ſtand for a while before them, till they have made Reverences to them five or ſix times one after another, which is performed by croſſing themſelves with three Fingers of their right Hand, and by ſaying with a low voice, <hi>Goſpodi Pomilui,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>God have mercy on me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They do addreſs themſelves with the ſame Veneration and Prayers to the Croſſes they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98085:42"/>
meet by the way, ſo that they are obſerved to ſtop themſelves every moment. And theſe profound Reverences to their Images, and the ſigning themſelves with the Croſs at the ſame time, and crying <hi>Goſpodi Pomilui,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Devotions the Parents do teach their Children. When a <hi>Moſcovite</hi> enters into another Man's houſe, he firſt looks about for the Saint, and having paid his Reverence there, he turns about and ſalutes the Family. When they buy any of theſe Images, they take great caution of ſaying, they have bought them, but chooſe rather to ſay, they have changed them for Silver. When they grow old or rotten, they either bury them with ſome Ceremonie, or throw them into ſome River, and expoſe them to the mercy of the Current. In ſhort, the ſign of the Croſs is ſo uſual amongſt them, that they are perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at it, and do make it the ordinary preface of all their civil Actions.</p>
               <p>On Sundays and their Feſtival days, they go three times to Church, Morning, Noon, and Evening; and are ſtanding and unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all the time of Divine ſervice, for which reaſon, they have neither benches nor ſeats in their Churches. The moſt devout enter not into the Church, but perform their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the door amongſt the Women, who being lookt upon as more impure than the Men, have not ſo eaſie an admiſſion as they. A
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98085:43"/>
perſon who that day hath had knowledge of his Wife, ought not to enter into the Church, till he hath waſhed himſelf and put on a clean ſhirt. They have no preaching amongſt them, ſo that their whole Service conſiſts in the reading of certain Pſalmes or Chapters in the Bible by their Prieſt, and (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion) <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed; or elſe they Sing their Prayers with a very high voice, and adding ſometimes after that a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> They ſay their Prayers ſtanding, only when they come to the <hi>Goſpodi,</hi> they bow their Heads to the very ground, beating it with their fore-head. And this is the whole Service of their Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, in which many amongſt them forbear not any labour or travail. As to their Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, beſides their Sundays, they obſerve but fifteen, that is to ſay, the Nativity of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> on the eighth of <hi>September;</hi> the Exaltation of the Croſs, the fourteenth of the ſame; the Oblation of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the one and twentieth of <hi>November;</hi> the Nativity of our bleſſed Saviour, the five and twentieth of <hi>December;</hi> the Epiphany or Feaſt of Kings on the ſixth of <hi>January;</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delmas day, on the ſecond of <hi>February;</hi> the Annuntiation of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> on the five and twentieth of <hi>March;</hi> Palm-Sunday, Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-day, Aſcenſion-day, Whit-Sunday, the Feaſt of the Trinity next day after the Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98085:43"/>
All Saints-day the Sunday after, the Manifeſtation of the Glory of Chriſt upon the Mountain, being the ſixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the Aſcenſion of the Virgin the fifteenth of the ſame.</p>
               <p>If there be any Religion that obliges its Profeſſors to a ſevere Mortification, this muſt needs be confeſt to do it with moſt Rigour. For beſides that they faſt ordinarily on Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes-days, Fridays, and the Eves before holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, they have four Lents every year. The longeſt of them is like ours, of ſeven weeks, there is another that begins Eight dayes after the Pentecoſt and laſts to St. <hi>Peters</hi> day, the third holds from the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the ſixteenth, and the fourth from the twelfth of <hi>November</hi> till Chriſtmas day. During theſe Lents they Eat neither butter nor eggs nor milk, only the firſt weeke of their chief Lent they have liberty for all kind of Exceſs, ſave eating of fleſh. And indeed in this week (which ſerves them as a Carneval) their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies are incredible, and as if their debauches were a preparative to their faſting, the inſolencies of drunken men are ſuch, that at <hi>Moſcow</hi> eſpecially, it is very unſafe walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtreets in the night. But after this week they live ſo ſoberly that the moſt ſtrict of them eat no fiſh but on ſundays, and drink nothing at all but <hi>Quaz</hi> or fair water. They content them ſelves with pulſe, and hearbs,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98085:44"/>
but above all with Garlick and Onyons, of which they ſtink very enormouſly all Lent long; only now and then they indulge and ſweeten themſelves with hony. In the mean time the huſband being not allowed the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his wife, but tyed up from the pleaſures of matrimony, is ſubject as it were to double Lent, which is not to be tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed under a years excommunication.</p>
               <p>In their Confeſſions they ſtand upright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Images, and when the Prieſt gives them abſolution, he obliges them to certain penancies; the greateſt of which are, that they abſtain from <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> and from their wives, ſo that many times it falls out, a woman is puniſht for the ſins of her huſband. Or elſe they enjoyn them when they come to Church to come no further than the Porch, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſo many times the <hi>Goſpodi,</hi> to make ſuch a number of reverences to their Saints, to waſh themſelves with holy water, which is conſecrated on the Epiphany, and which the Prieſts know very well how to diſtribute for their own advantage.</p>
               <p>They commonly take the Communion on a Faſting day at Noon ſervice, and if any one receives on a Sunday, he muſt that day eat no Kind of fleſh. It is adminiſtred in both Kinds with leavened bread, and wine mingled with warm water, which repreſents the believers,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98085:44"/>
or rather (according to a Councel of the Eaſt aſſembled at Conſtantinople) the water that came forth with the blood from the moſt pretious ſide of our Saviour. There are none that receive in one kind only but chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren under ſeven years old, at which age as ſoon as they are arrived, they are admitted to communicate in both: becauſe (ſay they) at that age they begin to ſin Mortally. Some there are that will ſleep as ſoon as they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to prevent by that means any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinning. If a Prieſt on the Communion-day happen to touch any dead Corps, or be preſent at any funerall, he is lookt upon as defiled, and can neither Conſecrate nor Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacrament that day. But for what <hi>Oleareus</hi> alledges, that they believe a Tranſubſtantiation, I could not perceive any ſuch thing. And I have three reaſons that do principally perſwade me they are not yet fallen under ſo great an Errour: The firſt is, that when one diſcourſes with them about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of that belief, they will own it to be irrationall, and declare it abſurd and ridiculous, and they never betake themſelves (as the Catholicks do) to God's Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie to maintain it. The Second is, that if they did believe a reall Tranſubſtantiation, they would ſhow more reſpect than they do to that myſtery; and indeed it would be very ſtrange, if in a Religion ſo preciſe and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98085:45"/>
as theirs, they ſhould want Zeal and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration at a time wherein it ought to be moſt Eminent as it is amongſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. And laſtly were they of this opinion, which <hi>Olearius</hi> imputs to them, it muſt have bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to them from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from whom they received the ſcheme of their Religion, but neither do we find the <hi>Greeks</hi> under ſo great a blindneſſe.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> they have yearly many Proceſſions, but the principall and moſt ſolemne is on Palme-ſunday, by which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented our Saviours Entring into <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> They have Saints alſo that perform great miracles, if one will believe the ſtories they tell of them. Amongſt the Reſt, there is one of them called <hi>Serge,</hi> at <hi>Troitza,</hi> in the richeſt and moſt beautifull Convent in all <hi>Moſcovy;</hi> in which place he lived formerly ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, that at laſt he wrought Miracles. He died in the year 1563. and yet as we paſt by <hi>Troitza</hi> (which is a Town near <hi>Moſcow</hi>) they told us his countenance was as freſh as when he died. And to this Convent the <hi>Tzar</hi> does uſually go in Pilgrimage twice every year, he comes on horſeback within a league of the place, and then walks the reſt on foot.</p>
               <p>The Religious or Monaſticks eat no fleſh in their Convents, nor drink any thing but <hi>Quaz,</hi> but when they are out of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98085:45"/>
they have liberty to drink what they pleaſe. In this Country a man may forſake his Wife, and Children, and betake himſelf to a Convent; if a Woman be barren, her Huſband hath power to quit himſelf of her, and diſpoſe her into a Religious houſe; and the <hi>Tzars</hi> themſelves when they have none but Daughters, do ſerve theirs in the ſame kind. Moreover, he that can convince his Wife of fornication hath it at his choice to ſhave her and clap her up in a Nunnery, and marry again within ſix weeks after the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce. I call it <hi>Fornication</hi> and not <hi>Adultery,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> believe there is no Adultery but marrying another mans wife.</p>
               <p>They do not believe there is a Purgatorie, but they hold there are two diſtinct places where the Souls that are ſeparated from their bodies do remain in expectation of the day of Judgment. One of them is the Manſion of the Bleſſed, where they enjoy (as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) the converſation of Angels, with all ſort of Pleaſure and Delight; the Other of the Wicked, in a diſmal Valley, where they have no other aſſociates but Divels. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, they believe the Souls of the Wicked are not altogether uncapable of Comfort, but that by the prayers and the perfumes of their Prieſts, they may be forced back out of the very jaws of Hell. And for this cauſe their Prieſts will pray over their
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98085:46"/>
Sepulchers morning and night, for forty days, which is the term of their Mourning, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their departed Friends; and on the Eve before the Pentecoſt they perform cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain annuall Ceremonies in their behalf; which though very formal, are altogether moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</p>
               <p>In their Hierarchie, they have for their chief a Patriarch, elected by the <hi>Tzar,</hi> and it is this Patriarch that judges in all Cauſes Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and diſpoſes abſolutely in all matters of Religion; He hath his pallace in <hi>Moſco</hi> in the great Dukes Caſtle. After him, there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Metropolitans and Biſhops, diſperſt into ſundry parts of the Country. The reſt of the Clergy is compoſed of Proto-popes, and Popes, or ſimple Prieſts, which are obliged (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all other Eccleſiaſticall Perſons) to marry before they receive Orders, but if their wife dies, they are to remaine widdowers as long as they live, becauſe (ſay they) the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle would have a Biſhop to be the huſband but of one wife in the 1 <hi>Tim. ch.</hi> 3: whereas Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning is that a Biſhop ſhould have but one wife at a time, Poligamy being in his time a very Ordinary vice. And hence it is that one of theſe Prieſts being a wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower is not permitted to adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, nor to marry, he has only liberty to aſſiſt at Morning and Everning ſervice, not at Noon, at which time they uſually Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98085:46"/>
as I have ſaid before. Nevertheleſs, if one of theſe Prieſt be unſatisfied with his Condition, he may freely relinquiſh his charge, and lay by his veſt and his Cap which they put upon him at his Conſecration, and after that become a Mechanick if he thinks it for his advantage.</p>

               <head>Of the Ambaſſadors ſtay at <hi>Archangel.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving given a ſufficient deſcription of <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> it is time we return now to ſpeak againe of our Voiage; But before we leave <hi>Archangel,</hi> it will be convenient to ſay ſomething of the Town, and that little Reſidence we made there.</p>
               <p>The Town of <hi>Archangel</hi> (ſo called from St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-angel) is ſituated on the bank of the River <hi>Duina,</hi> on the left hand as you paſs from the <hi>White</hi> Sea. When we were there it was not very great, but yet ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous by reaſon of the great trading thither, that it was ſcarce capable of all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. And indeed it is in reſpect of the Commerce eſpecially, that this Town is ſo conſiderable; for hither it is that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> &amp; the <hi>Hollander,</hi> amongſt other Commodities, tranſport Cloth, Velvets, Damask, Spices, Tinn, Lead, Wine, and ſtrong Waters. But becauſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98085:47"/>
the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> ſwallow down ſmall Wines like River water, therefore they ſend them no <hi>French</hi> nor <hi>Rheniſh</hi> Wines, as being not ſtrong enough for them. On the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> ſide there is great ſtore of Corn exported, of Cavyar, Furs, Hemp, Ruſſia-leather, and Wax. It is above an hundred years ſince this trade was brought hither by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from <hi>Narve,</hi> in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth King of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ivan Baſilovitz</hi> Emperour of <hi>Moſcovie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth having ſet out a Fleet, for the eſtabliſhing a Trade in ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Country, the Fleet having followed the Northern paſſage, was at length brought into this Port. And hence it was that <hi>Ivan Baſilovitz</hi> (to recompence the generous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whoſe pains and induſtry had opened a Trade into theſe parts) gave them a Priviledge of Commerce to that Town without any Cuſtome or Impoſt. And this was the occaſion upon which the great Amity betwixt the two Crowns was eſtabliſhed, to the no ſmall Advantage both of the one and the other.</p>
               <p>After we, that made our Voyage in the Merchant-man, were arrived at <hi>Archangel,</hi> his Excellence inquired particularly into the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our delay, and of Mr. <hi>Watſons</hi> deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who was parted from us. Upon which the Maſter of the Ship made a great Apology
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98085:47"/>
for himſelf, laying the fault upon the winds, and taking occaſion of Mr. <hi>Watſon's</hi> abſence, he accuſed him alſo (beſides many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar points) of being partly the cauſe that our Expedition had been no greater. But it was anſwered ſufficiently againſt the Maſters Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, both by the Sea-men and us. And indeed had the Maſter come to an harbour either in <hi>Norway</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> as he was often deſired by Mr. <hi>Watſon,</hi> rather than ſtay till the Ship was bruiſed to pieces to get her repaired in <hi>England,</hi> ſixty or ſeventy Leagues out of our way, it is very likely we might have been two or three Weeks ſooner at our Port. And ſo it was doubtleſs rather the Maſter of the Ships than Maſter <hi>Watſons</hi> fault, that we had ſtayed ſo long behind my Lord Ambaſſador, and that his Excellency had not only the apprehenſion we ſhould have been caſt away, but the continuation of his Voiage differred very long, to ſome great diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>However, while the Ambaſſador ſtayed at <hi>Archangel,</hi> he had all manner of good Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, which taſted very pleaſant to us, who newly had made an end of a long and very hard Voiage amongſt the troubles of the Sea. Therefore we took our good ſhare of it, and in the mean time we took alſo a view of the Town while we had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98085:48"/>
during one Weeks time his Excellency ſtayed in it ſince our arrival. As for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment given us in this Town, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo great and plentiful with all kind of Proviſion, that we wanted nothing but a great number of Cooks to get it dreſſed, and more People to conſume it. And that we took to be a good Omen for the reſt of our Travails tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough that Country: but we were miſtaken in it, for we experienced the contrary in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places upon a very bad account. Howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Ambaſſadors meat was alwaies dreſſed after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> way by his own Cooks, and all the bread that was eaten at his Table, was made alſo by his own Baker. What was eaten beſides, was after the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> faſhion which ſeemed at firſt ſomething ſtrange to us, for they bake it in ſuch manner that it hath ſcarce any cruſt at all. As for Drink, we were plentifully provided with Beer, Mead, <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> divers ſorts of Wines, and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> amongſt the reſt. The Ambaſſadors from the <hi>Tzar,</hi> who about two moneths before had arrived at <hi>Archangel</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion given us fair recommendation by the report they had publiſhed at this Town, and thorough the whole Road to <hi>Moſco,</hi> of the extraordinary Reception which had been given them by the King of great <hi>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I ſhall take the liberty of ſpeaking ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the People called <hi>Samojedes,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98085:48"/>
occaſion of ſome of them that we ſaw at <hi>Archangel.</hi> They are of a Country very bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, but under the <hi>Tzars</hi> dominion, and of a long time inſtructed in the Religion of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Their Habitation is under the frozen Zone, near the antient <hi>Scythia,</hi> toward the <hi>Ryphean</hi> or <hi>Hyperborean</hi> Mountains, which are next neighbours to <hi>Petzora</hi> which I have mentioned before. The word <hi>Samojedes</hi> denotes what they have formerly been, <hi>viz. Anthropophagi</hi> or ſuch as eat mansfleſh: for <hi>Samojedes</hi> is compoſed of <hi>Sam</hi> which ſignifies ones ſelf, and <hi>Jeda</hi> which ſignifies to eat; and indeed they did uſe to eat the bodies of their dead friends with Veniſon. The Sun (that robs them of his preſence in their Contry five or ſix Months every year) obligeth them to make proviſion in ſummer of whatever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their livelyhood in ſo tedious an obſcurity; againſt which they have no better remedy than the brightneſs of their lamps, which are fed with a certain oyl drawn out of Fiſh. It is reported that their houſes are built half way under ground, and that for their mutual converſation in winter, they are forced to make trenches in ſtead of ſheets, and that in ſummer time they march out from their impriſonment at their Chimneys. Their Common ſuſtenance is Veniſon, honey, or a certaine fiſh dried in the Wind or the Sun, without any bread at all. They wear a Kind
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98085:49"/>
of Veſt half way down their legs which they make of Buck ſkins or the ſkins of Rein Deer with the Furrs turned outwards. Theſe Veſts have no other parts open than the bottom by which they get into them, and the upper part where they put out their face, for they cover the head with it as the <hi>Capuchinos</hi> do: but the cap has the ſame faſhion with the head of a Man. At the end of their ſleevs they have their Muffs Sown half on, that they may have it at their choice, to make uſe of them or let them hang looſe as they have occaſion. They wear Bootes, but with the Furr on the outſide, which Garb appears ſo horrid, that it is a hard matter at firſt ſight not to be frighted to ſee them habited in furs like ſavage Beaſts. Under their Veſts they wear ſhirts made of the ſkins of young Reine Deer which are much ſofter than linnen, and under thoſe ſhirts Drawers. They uſe alſo a very large ſort of Bonnets which hang down round about their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and are commonly made of cloth and lined with furr. Their Stature is but low, their Faces flatt and broad like the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and their Hair long. Two or three of theſe <hi>Samojedes</hi> were brought to his Excellency, with whom he entertained himſelf for ſome time with ſeveral queſtions which he aſkt them touching their manner of living. He had the diverſion alſo to ſee them dance after the mode of their Country, which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98085:49"/>
was the moſt ridiculous in the World.</p>
               <p>The Preparation his Excellence made for his Voiage up the River conſiſted of ſix barges or great boates for his train and baggage, of which one was ſet apart for his Kitchin, and a hearth and Chimney contrived in it; and an other for his Coach horſes. Beſides theſe ſix there was one Barque peculiar to the <hi>Priſtaff,</hi> who reſolved to carry his wife along with him. The day of our departure being at hand, his Excellence and all his Gentlemen provided themſelves with gowns and coats lined with furr, ſome of martin, others of ſables, beaver, fox, or ſquirell, to defend themſelves from the ſeverity of the Cold which was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently increaſed at <hi>Archangel</hi> when we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there. The moſt of them bought Caps li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with furr according to the <hi>Polonian</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, ſome bought alſo their Caps like the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mojedes,</hi> others for curioſity ſake bought whole ſuits ready made, which coſt them but about ten ſhillings. The Governor of the Town alſo would needs give us ſupplyes againſt the Winter, and preſent moſt of my Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors domeſticks with Sheep ſkins dreſt after the faſhion of <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> and ſome fair Buck ſkins to ly upon inſtead of quilts.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ON Saturday the twelfth of <hi>September</hi> his Excellence departed from <hi>Archangel</hi> with all his Train, and came the next day to <hi>Colmogro,</hi> and on the nineteenth to <hi>Arſinoa,</hi> which is two hundred and fifty Verſts (every Verſt being the fourth part of a League) from <hi>Archangel.</hi> On the two and twentieth we parted from <hi>Arſinoa,</hi> and on the ſeven and twentieth arrived at <hi>Yagriſh</hi> one hundred and thirty long Verſts, and from <hi>Yagriſh</hi> to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſtiga,</hi> which is one hundred and fifty Verſts in five days. The third of <hi>October</hi> we left <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſtiga</hi> is two hundred and fifty Verſts. From thence in three days we came to <hi>Chouſca</hi> one hundred and forty Verſts, and on Saturday the ſeventeenth of <hi>October</hi> we arrived at <hi>Vologda,</hi> which is ninety Verſts from <hi>Chouſca.</hi> So as this Voiage of two hundred and fifty Leagues took us up five weeks compleat, in the Relation of which I ſhall firſt ſpeak ſomething in general concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the manner of our Navigation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:98085:50"/>We made no uſe of Horſes for the haleing our Barques from <hi>Archangel</hi> to <hi>Vologda,</hi> but (notwithſtanding it was up the River) we performed all with men, ſo that ordinarily we had no leſs than three hundred with us. The River is not very rapid but in certain pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where we were ſometimes conſtrained to imploy the Water-men of two boats for drawing up a ſingle one againſt the oppoſition of the ſtream. But his Excellence fearing (and not without reaſon) the River would freez before we could finiſh our Voiage, he entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Priſtaf Bogdan</hi> to go before, that we might have freſh watermen ready at our arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val in every relay; &amp; that all neceſſary proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being provided before hand, we might have no occaſion lo loſe our time. But this care was very ill ſeconded by our Pilots, who ran us ſeveral times upon ground, ſo that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we ſpent two or three hours in diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging a boat from the Rocks. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we received ſo horrible concuſſions, that it was a wonder the barque was not broke to pieces under us, and this gave one occaſion to ſay, that peradventure the Boats did break the Rocks. In the night time ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the Boat-men made fires in the Woods, as if they would have ſet all <hi>Moſcovie</hi> on fire, and when they had done, laid themſelves down by it to ſleep very civilly upon the banks of the River.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:98085:51"/>We had alwaies very good proviſion of Victuals, and eſpecially of ſtrong Waters, of Wine, Mead, and Quaz, of which we laded a barque at <hi>Archangel</hi> to ſerve us the whole Voiage. The Barque which we had made our Kitchin, furniſhed all the reſt with meat, and in particular his Excellencies, by getting them cloſe one to another, in ſuch a manner, that thoſe that were in the Ambaſſador's Veſſel received the diſhes from the hands of the Cooks, to carry them two or three ſteps to his Table: Whereas the other boats were glad to make uſe of their skifs to fetch their proviſion dayly.</p>
               <p>In this Voiage Walking was our greateſt Recreation, for whilſt our barques were drawn by the men, and advanced but a ſmall pace, we went a-ſhore in our skifs. The Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Umbrages which the continual Foreſts caſt upon the River, the excellent Verdure wherewith they were adorned all the way, together with the favourableneſs of the Weather invited us to it, and many times made us loſe all ſenſe of wearineſs; ſometimes alſo we had the diverſion of Shooting, by reaſon of the many wild Ducks and Pigeons that <hi>Moſcovie</hi> is provided with. In ſhort, we ſaw never a Town conſiderable enough to have any particular Deſcription. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſtiga</hi> (which is the principal in a Province of that name) is the greateſt we ſaw, but
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98085:51"/>
it is built of wood, as the reſt are, and paved only with piles of Firr. True it is here we had now and then liberty to ſee their Churches, which in <hi>Moſco</hi> they will not permit to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of another Religion, for they believe them profaned, when any ſuch ſet their feet in them. Betwixt <hi>Archangel</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſtiga</hi> we ſaw ſeveral Rocks of Alabaſter, or white Marble, as we paſſed upon the River.</p>
               <p>This being the manner of our Voiage, it remains now that we preſent you with ſome circumſtances that happened in our Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all it was uſual as we paſt by any Village, to have the Prieſt come to his Excellencies boat, with a preſent of Fiſh, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal Gooſe-berries, or ſometimes a Hen with ſome few Eggs, in hopes of receiving ſome reward from the Ambaſſador: And drinking <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> which they guſled down with ſo much pleaſure, they commonly went home again drunk.</p>
               <p>The next day after we parted from <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel,</hi> the <hi>Priſtaf</hi> brought his Wife into the Ambaſſadors barque. She was very richly dreſſed with Pearls and precious Stones, and (had ſhe not been painted) might have paſt for very handſom; however his Excellence vouchſafed to honour her with a Salute, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98085:52"/>
entertained her with great Civility, preſenting her according to the cuſtome of the place with a Cup of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> till Dinner came in. Within a little time after ſhe was unhappily deprived of her Huſband, for being arrived at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſtiga,</hi> he found himſelf ſeiſed with a diſtemper which in a ſhort time ended both his Life and Voiage.</p>
               <p>Being arrived near <hi>Arſinoa</hi> the Ambaſſador expecting to have found boat-men ready for his departure, was conſtrained himſelf to provide them, after he had attended three whole days. The Governour of this Town had had advertiſement from the Governour of <hi>Archangel</hi> to have all things ready in good time, and the like notice he had alſo from the <hi>Priſtaf;</hi> but he deſpiſed all, and ranted (as if he had been in a frenzy) againſt all ſuch as were employed in the buſineſs, reſolving the Ambaſſador ſhould go back if he pleaſed, rather than he would be troubled with any thing. So that his Excellence was neceſſitated at his own proper charges to hire ſome of the Water-men that had brought us from <hi>Colmogro</hi> to carry us to <hi>Yagriſh,</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the reſt at <hi>Arſinoa.</hi> In the mean while we ſaw a Wolf upon the bank of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver running up and down, which ſome fancied was the Governour dreſſed in that diſguiſe, to take a view of the Ambaſſador and his train. We clapt ſome dogs after him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98085:52"/>
but he ran the foile ſo cunningly, that we loſt him in a moment.</p>
               <p>On the 26. of <hi>September</hi> at Night there was an unlucky accident befel fifteen of our boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who put themſelves in a huddle into a skif to come to one of the barques, and falling down the River ſuffered their boat to be carried away by the ſtream with that violence, that it fell foul upon one of the barques, and was overturned, and ſeven of the fifteen were drowned, the reſt ſaving themſelves by ſwimming. Another time one of our water-men fell off the Decks into the River, and having no skill in ſwimming, he was in the greateſt danger of the World; But as he was juſt ſinking, a Boat was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſpatched, which took him up, and after he had drunk two or three good draughts of ſtrong Waters, he found himſelf very well again. Which made me imagine that had the water of the River been <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> he would have thought they had done him a great injury to preſerve him, and would rather have choſe to have died with that plenty than to have lived in want of it. About this time alſo we received the News that <hi>Archangel</hi> was burnt, and almoſt all reduced into aſhes preſently after our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
               <p>The Governor of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſtiga</hi> expreſſed great Civilities to my Lord Ambaſſador, and was
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98085:53"/>
clearly of another humour than the Governor of <hi>Arſinoa;</hi> yet it was without violating a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom they have to ſee no forreign Ambaſſadors themſelves. Nevertheleſſe he tendred his ſervice and all that he was able to do by one of his Gentelmen, and provided us abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly with all things neceſſary for our Voiage by the means of two honeſt Officers which he deputed <hi>Priſtaffs</hi> in the place of <hi>Bogdan</hi> lately deceaſed. For this reaſon his Excellence would not depart from thence till he had made him ſome acknowledgment, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him by one of his Gentlemen with three douzain bottels of Canary and French wine. We ſtayed only two days in this Town, and from thence made all poſſible haſt becauſe the Rever began to be frozen. At this time every of our barques having two Maſts, one for our Sayles and another for our Ropes, we were fain to cut our Sayls Maſt to make our barques the lighter; for betwixt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſtiga</hi> and <hi>Vologda,</hi> they cannot in thoſe large Boats upon the River <hi>Sucagna</hi> (which runs into the <hi>Duina</hi> hard by) make uſe of their Sayles by reaſon of the great number of Rocks betwixt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſtiga,</hi> and <hi>Tetma.</hi> His Excellence to lighten his Veſſel yet more, left there a hundred In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots or Rigs of lead, for notwithſtanding it was ſtill haled with threeſcore and ten men, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs went the moſt heaviely of them all, becauſe of its bulk and freight. For beſides
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98085:53"/>
ſeven or eight boatmen who guided it, there were always aboard the ſame thirty perſons, beſides a great quantity of Goods, which was the cauſe that ſeveral in that Veſſel were very narrowly lodged. This Lead above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned was deſigned amongſt the reſt of the preſents for the <hi>Tzar</hi> which the King of <hi>England</hi> ſent him, and for that purpoſe was brought to his Excellence a little after our arrival at <hi>Vologda,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now by this time the Winter was ſo farr advanced, that our Voiage began to be grievous and inſupportable; for there being no Convenience for fire to warm our ſelves we had no relief but from our furrs, and ſtrong waters (which we began to take down in good luſty draughts) or elſe by walking, although the ground was already covered with ſnow. Inſomuch that in a ſhort time we were all in our Robes, ſome like <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> others like the <hi>Samojedes,</hi> and ſome of them in their Sheep-ſkin Veſts with long ſleeves, reſembling thoſe old and eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinies, whom <hi>Venus</hi> did ſo laugh at when ſhe ſaw them in their habits, thoſe like the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mojedes</hi> looking ſo hideouſly that we made a good ſport with them. At length we found the froſt increaſing by degrees, ſo that at our parting from <hi>Rouſea</hi> we found the River ſo frozen to <hi>Vologda</hi> about twenty miles, that we were forced to break the ice
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98085:54"/>
before our firſt Veſſel which guided the reſt in the way.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Tetma</hi> we were no ſooner arrived but the Governor came, though it was night, to ſalute the Ambaſſador; who ſurpriſed with the unuſualneſs of his civility, received him with great courteſy and treated him in his Barque. The Governor was in his perſon like a <hi>Boyar,</hi> thick, and fat, and corpulent, as moſt of the Governors of Provinces generally are; otherwiſe he was a pleaſant man, good company, and very richly clad. He expreſt great civilities to the Ambaſſador, tendring his aſſiſtance in any thing which lay in his power, in acknowledgment whereof his Excellence ſent him a preſent the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of three Els of ſcarlet cloth by Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> his Steward. He received it with great Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and thanks, and preſented Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> with a pair of Sables worth about four pounds ſterling, at the ſame time expreſſing a deſire once more to recreate himſelf aboard us. His Excellence being gone, Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> prepared to entertain him, and conſpired with ſome other Gentlemen who were in his boat to try whether the Governors head were able to bear a luſty cup or no. But the deſign ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded very ill, for he defended himſelf ſo well in this debauch, that he came off much better than all the reſt.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vologda</hi> is the chief City of a Province of the ſame name, it is very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable both in reſpect of its bigneſs, and of a ſtrong ſtone wall which ſurrounds it. The River makes it a place of great trading, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very populous. It is ſituate on the right hand of the River, like <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſtiga, Colmogro,</hi> and <hi>Tetma,</hi> all raiſed upon the banks, and the River running under them.</p>
               <p>Our Lodgings were taken up in the Suburbs of the Town near the Rivers ſide: but the houſes there being ſmall and uncapable of ſuch a number, we were forced to take up ſix or ſeven more, and lye diſperſed about the Town. In this poſture we continued three months in this place; contrary to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies deſign, who was to paſs immediately to <hi>Moſco,</hi> as ſoon as it was poſſible for him to travail in Sledges: and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to attend, till the froſt hardning the ſnow ſhould make the ways paſſable. At our firſt coming we did not think to ſtay above a month, the ground having been a long time covered with ſnow, and the aire in appearance diſpoſed to freez it well. Yet after our arrival the weather proved ſo moiſt,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98085:55"/>
that in a ſhort time we ſaw the ground unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the River giving free paſſage to the Boats. So that in the mean while we paſſed our time very ill, in reſpect of the raine and dirt, which was ſo great, that for the ſpace of a month or five weeks, we ſcarce ever durſt ſet a foot in the Streets. But that which was an Aggravation of our trouble, was an impatience we all had to be at <hi>Moſco,</hi> and indeed it was a hard matter for us to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in a Town that kept us ſo long from that where his Excellencies Embaſſie to the <hi>Tzar</hi> determined, and where we hoped to have a happy repoſe. In the mean time from the firſt day of our arrival we began to warm our chambers with our furnaces of ſtone, which is indeed a very convenient invention in ſo cold a Country: but not being able to endure them to that degree of heat the <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> do, we were fain to uſe them with more moderation.</p>
               <p>At firſt our Entertainment was very good, and regulated as the Ambaſſador pleaſed; ſo that we had plenty enough of all things, and yet nothing ſuperfluous. But as Soon as <hi>Neſtrof</hi> and <hi>Davidof</hi> (which the <hi>Tzar</hi> had ſent from his Court in the quality of <hi>Priſtafs</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct his Excellence to <hi>Moſco</hi>) were arrived at <hi>Vologda</hi> in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> our diet and accommodation was ſo altered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched that there could be nothing more
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98085:55"/>
mean and diſhonourable. <hi>Neſtrof,</hi> was a <hi>Stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> (which is as much as to ſay, a Gentleman waiting at the <hi>Tzars</hi> Table) the other was a <hi>Diack</hi> (which is an office importing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing higher than a Secretary, but lower than a Chancellor) <hi>Neſtrof</hi> was he that took all upon him, managed the whole Oeconomie, and made all things depend upon his own conduct. His arrogance had no bounds in all his actions, nor was it leſs remarquable in his languages: he was a perſon like himſelf in every thing, and little cared to diſſemble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a civil man. This was the form of his Complement to the Ambaſſador the next day after his arrival, having with a grave impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and auſtere brow entered the Hall, where his Excellence received them; <hi>The moſt Serene</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>and Puiſſant Great Lord, Tzar and Grand Duke, Alexey Michailovitz,</hi> (with a long enumeration of Titles, which had been Treaſon in him to have omitted) <hi>is very joyful to underſtand that you the great Ambaſſador of his Majeſtie of Great Brittain, &amp;c. are ſo happily arrived here, and hath commanded, that We and your Excellence go together to Moſco.</hi> Not contenting himſelf to ſay bluntly, <hi>the Tzar had commanded him</hi> (deſigning thereby to bring the Ambaſſador under the <hi>Tzar's</hi> command) with yet higher <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98085:56"/>
ſaid, <hi>the Tzar had commanded them and his Excellence to go in company to Moſco;</hi> True it is he ſweetned his diſcourſe a little after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when having preferred himſelf before, he condeſcended to make him his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in theſe words, <hi>We muſt go in company together to Moſco;</hi> and it was a wonder to me (as he had placed the Ambaſſador in his Speech) he did not ſay, <hi>and you muſt come after me.</hi> This is the Character of <hi>Neſtrof,</hi> the moſt inſolent and rude man we met with in all <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> he it was who undertook to regulate our Table aſſoon as he arrived, before he had ever thought of regulating the inſolence of his Nature; as if he had believed his credit and authority could not have any way been ſignified bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than by rendring himſelf ſurly, proud, and inſupportable. It was at this time one of their Lents, and we obſerved it ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we could ſcarce get Tallow or Wax candles, for nothing could eſcape the good huſbandrie of <hi>Neſtrof.</hi> There was nothing wherein he did not retrench us, inſomuch that at one blow we were fallen from plenty to want, and inſtead of making our reſidence there comfortable to us, he diſobliged us ſo much, that from his firſt arrival we had reaſon to admire the civility of our treatment at <hi>Archangel.</hi> In the mean time we comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our ſelves in the Shortneſs of the days,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98085:56"/>
and the Hopes we had of departing ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly for <hi>Moſco,</hi> where our condition was like to be much better.</p>
               <p>The affaires of our Houſe being thus eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, the Ambaſſador took particular care of our Devotions. He appointed the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to read Prayers twice a day, and that there ſhould be a Sermon every Sunday. He commanded all his domeſtiques to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly preſent at the ſame, the Catholicks only excepted, in which number he had four <hi>French</hi> men: the Chirurgeon, the Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, and two Cooks. Theſe had all their liberty of Conſcience, but it was very ſeldom they made uſe of it. At Chriſtmas we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Communion.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all the Divertiſements we had in this Town (beſides muſique, dancing, and ſome other Recreations we uſed at home, during the rain, to divert the tediouſneſs of the time) Hunting was our beſt and moſt uſual entertainment, when the Snow was fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen upon the ground. Our Muſique was moſt commonly at Dinner, at which time there was nothing to be heard but Trumpets and Viols, whoſe delightful and agreeable Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, did ſometimes ſo charm the <hi>Ruſſes,</hi> that it drew great Company of them to hear it. And indeed the Muſique was very good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing managed by one of the beſt experienced Muſicians of <hi>England,</hi> who from time to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98085:57"/>
time compoſed new aires. Our dancing alſo, which the Ambaſſador uſed ſometimes upon occaſion of this Muſique, was no leſs admired by them, who in their Dances knew nothing but brutiſh and uncomely Poſtures, But when the River was ſtopt up to the boats, and the Snow was frozen upon the ground, which was not till the latter end of <hi>November,</hi> Hare-hunting was our principal ſport, of which Creatures we found ſuch plenty, that we could very well entertain our ſelves amongſt them from morning till night; and then we went a hunting in our Sledges. But they that knew how to march upon their Scates, did alſo divert themſelves with ſliding upon the River. Moreover the Baths were grown very familiar amongſt us, for beſides the pleaſure, we found great refreſhment by them. We had alſo the Celebration of ſeveral Feſtivals, but principally of the fifth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> which we kept in Memory of the happy Diſcovery of the Treaſon contrived againſt King <hi>James</hi> at <hi>London.</hi> We began our Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the night by artificial fire-works, made by an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> with great ſkill and ſucceſs; and the ſame was continued by a great Feaſt which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants were invited to, and by a pleaſant farce of Maſcarads after Supper, and concluded with dancing.</p>
               <p>And thus have you ſeen the manner of our
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98085:57"/>
living during our Reſidence at <hi>Vologda:</hi> I ſhall now preſent you with ſome particular circumſtances, before I proceed to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of our Voiage betwixt <hi>Vologda</hi> and <hi>Moſco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although Tobacco be forbidden in this Country with great ſeverity, yet there were ſome of the Ambaſſadors Servants who drove a private Trade with it in this Town, and that with ſo much advantage, that ſometimes they ſold the moſt ordinarie tobacco (which coſt them in <hi>London</hi> not above nine pence or ten pence the pound) for fifteen ſhillings the pound to the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> who ſtole to them with great ſecrecy to buy it. It is a Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity they love ſo well in thoſe parts, that if they want mony they will truck their ſhirts for tobacco: which they take ſo brutiſhly that I was almoſt frighted to ſee ſuch of them as waited on the Ambaſſador ſmoaking it when they had opportunity. Inſtead of Pipes they have an Engine made of a Cows horn, in the middle of which they pierce a hole and therein place the Veſſel which holds their tobacco. The Veſſel is commonly made of wood, very wide and indifferently deep, which when they have filled with tobacco, they put water into the horn to temper the ſmoak; then they lighten their pipe with a firebrand, and ſuck the ſmoak thorough the horn with ſuch greedineſs, that they make not above
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98085:58"/>
two ſucks of a pipe; and when they whiffe it out of their mouths, they raiſe ſuch a cloud that it hides all their face; and immediatly after they fall drunk upon the ground. Five or ſix of them one after another have I ſeen tumbling in this manner, and ſo drunk that they had ſcarce time to give their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions theis pipes, and for half a quarter of an hour they will ly in this pickle as inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as if they had the falling ſickneſs. But aſſoon as they begin to revive, and the ſmoak of the tobacco hath had its operation, they leap up in an inſtant one after another more briſk and lively than they were before, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing it a moſt admirable invention for purging the head. Red cloth, and Grey eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially are of that eſteem in this Town, that ſome of us could hardly forbear ſelling our cloaths off our backs, to accomodate them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time his Excellencies family was increaſt by the birth of a ſon, of which the Buttlers wife was brought to bed, having been big with child before ſhe came out from <hi>London.</hi> But the Parents being both Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and the child to be educated in that way, our Miniſter made ſome difficulty to baptiſe it, as not being born within our pale. Yet upon Conſultation concerning the matter it was judged neceſſary it ſhould be Chriſtned preſently, rather than have its baptiſm ſuſpended, in regard that as to the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98085:58"/>
eſſence of the Sacrament, both Proteſtants &amp; Roman Catholicks, do hold our adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it ſufficient, and upon that ſcore both the one ſide and the other receive their proſelites without Injunction of being rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed. And thus his Excellencies family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented a Commonwealth rather than a private houſe, ſome laying there the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Marriage, as the good man that hurt himſelf in the Merchant-man at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> ſome conceiving with child whilſt others were delivered, and this very woman happen'd to ſerve as a Nurſe, when the Counteſs (who accompanied My Lord Ambaſſador) was brought to bed of a ſon at <hi>Copenhagen</hi> in <hi>Denmark.</hi> So that at length there were three or four families comprehended in Ours; we married, we Chriſtened in our houſe, we heard ſermons there, and received the Sacrament; our Chaplain was Biſhop and Miniſter, he was the only perſon and all, that managed the affaires of our Church.</p>
               <p>During our ſtay here, there happened a Quarrel alſo betwixt two conſiderable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in his Excellencies train, at an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment made him by the Priſtaf at a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try houſe of his, two or three miles from <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logda.</hi> For his Excellence ſetting out late to return back to the Town, one of them fell in as cloſe as he could to the Ambaſſadors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who was then attended with ſixteen ſled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98085:59"/>
the other who was but then preparing to depart being come up to him, fell foul upon the former with deſign to quarrel with him, and nothing could ſerve his turn but he muſt ſtop his ſledg, that he himſelf might go before him according to his place. The other not at all pleaſed with ſo ſtrange a dealing, refuſed him and gave him withall ill language. Upon this they both betook themſelves to their ſwords and leaping on ſhore they fell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to fight. But the Ambaſſador having the alarm came preſently in, and ſeeing how defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient they had bin in their reſpect to his perſon, he uſed them both ſeverely. However every one lamented the ill fortune of the aſſailant, who appeared to have ingaged in this buſines upon a publique accompt, and made uſe of this only as an occaſion; the other being an imperious perſon, and one that (by reaſon of his long relation to his Excellence with had gained him ſome favours) ſeemed to deſpiſe the whole family. And indeed nothing but his long ſtanding in that family could be the ground of all his preſumption, for of his other qualities there was no body believed he had any reaſon to boaſt.</p>
               <p>In the 18. of <hi>December</hi> we ſaw that ſtrange repreſentation, that is annually made by the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> of the fiery furnace in which <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drech, Meſec,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> were caſt by the King of <hi>Babilon.</hi> The Perſons that act in it are
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98085:59"/>
diſguiſed, their beards rubbed over with honey, their hats of wood with which they run up and down the ſtreets, and with wild fire in their hand burn the hair or beard of any body they meet, with great inſolence. During this Extravagance the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> look upon them as ſo many Pagans and profane perſons, but on the feaſt of Kings they baptize them again, becauſe that day they believe was the firſt calling of the Gentils, and for that reaſon they return them into the boſome of the Church:</p>
               <p>Our devotions at Chriſtmas being over, my Lord Ambaſſador made all neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for our Voiage from <hi>Vologda</hi> to <hi>Moſco.</hi> In order to which he ſent to <hi>Neſtrof</hi> to deſire that he might have good ſledges chiefly for his Gentlemen, and that the ſame might attend them quite through his journey to ſpare the trouble of changing them by the way. But this demand was preſently rejected by Neſtrof, who had been will pleaſed if all his Excellencies Retinue would have marched on foot. His anſwer was, he could not furniſh him with any, but the Ordinary ſledges which are commonly very thin and ſplit in their ſides. Upon this anſwer my Lord Ambaſſador diſpatched his Secretary to him, who told him freely it was moſt undecent to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality worſe accommodated for their confidence in the Care of the <hi>Tzar</hi> ſo great a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98085:60"/>
Monarch, than if they had been at their own charges. He replied they might do as they pleaſed, no body hindered them from take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own courſe. And thereupon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that his Excellence had no reaſon, to complain, that his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty had done him extraordinary honor in ſending a perſon of his quality ſo far to conduct him to <hi>Moſco.</hi> To which the Secretary replied, that my Lord Ambaſſador acknowlegded his quality, but that he never thought it ſo great, that he and his aſſociate ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr themſelves before him as they had done at their firſt viſit. But after all this expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation his Excellence was conſtrained to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide himſelf of ſledges at his own charges. In the mean time to ſecure themſelves from the wind and the ſnow, every one took care to make himſelf a kind of a tilt of cloth ſtretched upon two or three hoops, as the people of quality of thoſe parts are uſed to do. And the weather being exceeding cold, the greateſt part lined their ſledges with a courſe kind of felt that is ſold on purpoſe for that uſe, as they did likewiſe their Coverlets with good furs to wrap themſelves up in. The reſt provided as well as they could to cover themſelves, ſo that our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mojedes</hi> Veſts were not with out imployment, nor were our Buck and Sheeps ſkin unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in this Voiage, everyone endeavouring
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98085:60"/>
above all things to be furniſhed with furrs againſt the cold.</p>

               <p>MY Lord Ambaſſador foreſeeing what the inconvenience would be if he marched with his whole train along with him, eſpecially from <hi>Vologda</hi> to <hi>Yeroſlaf,</hi> upon which road there was nothing but Villages, thought good to ſend before his Horſes and all things belonging to his Stables with ſixty ſledges, in which there was alſo a good part of his bagage, and ſome nine or ten Servants who had all their quarters aſſigned that they might have the better care of the Goods. The 7. of <hi>January</hi> 1664. they ſet forward, and on the 15. of the ſame moneth his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence with a Train of about an hundred and forty Sledges. On the 19. he arrived at <hi>Yeroſlaf,</hi> having croſſed the <hi>Volga</hi> at the Towns-end, which was Frozen over, and covered with Snow. The 22. we parted from <hi>Yeroſlaf</hi> all together, and paſſing by <hi>Roſtof,</hi> we came the 24. to <hi>Peroſlaf.</hi> The next day his Excellence departed from <hi>Peroſlaf,</hi> and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on the 27. at <hi>Troitza,</hi> where we ſtayed five days. At length we came to the <hi>Yawes</hi> on the third of <hi>February,</hi> which is a little
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98085:61"/>
Village ſome five Verſts from <hi>Moſco,</hi> and there it was my Lord Ambaſſador prepared himſelf for his Entry, which began the fifth, and was not finiſhed till the ſixth at Night.</p>
               <p>The Weather was ſo ſharp, and the Froſt ſo violent, when Mr. <hi>Godbolt</hi> (the Maſter of the Horſe) departed with my Lord's Coach and Horſes from <hi>Vologda,</hi> that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our proviſion of Furs, we thought we ſhould never have been able to overcome it. But this extremity continued not above five or ſix days, the Heavens had reſerved more mild and propitious weather for his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies departure, ſo that it thawed till the very day we arrived at <hi>Yeroſlaf;</hi> but it began then to reaſſume its former fierceneſs, as by very ſenſible Convictions we found afterwards. We marched as well night as day, every one in his ſledge at his full length. And, becauſe the upper parts of us were more expoſed to the injuries of the Aire, we took a particular care of covering our ſelves, and to ſtop all the chinks the cold might poſſibly come in at. We had every one of us (beſides our Furs) his bottle of ſtrong water, which we drunk off now and then as an excellent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative of Heat. The Kitchin went ſtill before with the <hi>Ruſs</hi> Harbingers, which the <hi>Priſtafs</hi> ſent away to take up our Lodgings in good time, and to get ſuch meat dreſſed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98085:61"/>
as they had along with them, and having diſpatched theſe away, they advanced to the next place ſome three or four hours before the Ambaſſador. The <hi>Priſtafs</hi> Equipage made the whole journey on horſe-back; true it is they were well mounted and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clad, yet in my judgment their manner of travailing was very much diſagreable with the Seaſon. The Waggoners or Drivers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was lamentable too, who as the other had no other covering than the Sky, but they had this advantage that they could warm themſelves as they ran by their Sledges ſides, beſides a certain dexterity they had got in begging ſtrong Waters, which they would do ſo frequently, it was a hard matter to prevent them by offering it. Moreover we had three Relaies or Stages by the way, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Yeroſlaf,</hi> at <hi>Peroſlaf,</hi> and at <hi>Troitza,</hi> where ſome of us changed both their Horſes and Sledges; others whom his Excellence had furniſhed with Sledges from <hi>Vologda,</hi> provided themſelves with freſh Horſes only, ſo that each of us had four ſeveral Waggoners or Drivers by the way.</p>
               <p>The greateſt Inconvenience I found in our whole Voiage was in our Lodging; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the accommodation of Inns is not known in that Country, there are very few Towns upon the Road that are capable of receiving an Ambaſſador. So that his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98085:62"/>
had never good Quarters, but at <hi>Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſlaf,</hi> at a <hi>Moſcovites</hi> houſe which was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built, and there we ſtayed near four compleat days to refreſh our ſelves, moſt of us lying in ſheets, which we had ſcarce done any where but there in our whole Voiage. Our uſual lodgings were Cabbins, or little Cottages of Wood, one ſtory high, black all over with ſmoak, ſo that to diſſipate the ſtinks which are occaſioned by the ſame, and the ſweltring heat of their ſkins, which would be otherwiſe intollerable, we were forced to keep the Windows continually open. But the greateſt trouble we had in theſe lodgings, or <hi>Wiſbies</hi> (as they call them) was when they heated their Stoves, for having no Chimneys they make their fires within ſide of the Chambers, and the ſmoak having no paſſage but at the Windows into the Streets, it is ſcarce poſſible to ſubſiſt one moment in that condition.</p>
               <p>And hence it was alſo we were ſo ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated with Diet: for, beſides that we almoſt alwaies eat in a Scramble, mutton, beef, or hens, which were roſted in their furnaces, was commonly our fare. They ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other invention for the dreſſing their meat, &amp; we doing it ordinarily in haſt, it fell out often our meat was but half dreſſed, inſomuch that ſome rather choſe to eat their meat that had been frozen in the way, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98085:62"/>
it had been better dreſſed. This it was that in the beginning of this Relation gave me occaſion to ſay, that amongſt the Utenſils of the Kitchin that the Ambaſſador brought from <hi>England,</hi> a Chimney would not have been ſuperfluous in ſeveral places. However as we were well lodged at <hi>Yeroſlaf,</hi> ſo our entertainment was very ſplendid, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Town ſhewing ſo much gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, that he would ſpare no coſt in rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Ambaſſador and his Train. There was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant there, that treated his Excellence very nobly, <hi>Neſtrof</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him twice alſo in his Voiage, and amongſt the reſt at <hi>Peroſlaf,</hi> where we had the diverſion of Muſique, though in a <hi>Wiſby</hi> all blackned with ſmoak.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, in the Condition where in we travailed, it was no eaſie matter for us to divert our ſelves being every one in his ſledg by himſelf as in another world, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well night as day amidſt the ſnow, and in the Violence of the winter, which to us ſeemed very bitter, though to the <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> it appeared very Favourable; Our Emploiment for the moſt part was ſleeping, the ſolitude, the warmth of our furrs, and the agreeable motion of our ſledges inviting us thereunto; ſo that the greateſt part of us did nothing almoſt but ſleep all the Voiage. And for this reaſon when we came near any
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98085:63"/>
Town or Village, the Ambaſſador gave order that the Trumpets ſhould ſound, to give advertiſement to his train.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſcovie</hi> being not very populous, and the Towns but of wood, my intention is not to delay my ſelf in deſcribing thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves in this Voiage. For, beſides that the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> are very ſcrupulous in permitting ſtrangers to ſee their forts, there are very few of their Towns worthy an exact deſcription. The handſomeſt we ſaw in this Journey is <hi>Yeroſlaf,</hi> no very great Town but remarquable for that the <hi>Volga</hi> runs by it, and renders it a place of good Trade and populous. At <hi>Peroſlaf</hi> there is a very narrow River, but above 100 fathoms deep, and by the ſide of the Town a little Lake which was frozen as well as the River, at that time. <hi>Troitza</hi> is a Town built upon the bending of a hill: in which there is a Covent that makes it very remarquable. It is built on a plain below the Town, all of ſtone, fortified with a faire Wall, and ſo rich that it maintains ordinarily 300 Monks. Here it was his Excellence was retarded five days in reſpect of the preparation that was making at <hi>Moſco</hi> for his Entry, and by reaſon that betwixt this place and <hi>Moſco,</hi> there was no other Town ſo proper for his ſtay, though in this alſo he was ſufficiently incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98085:63"/>
Yet in all the time he could not have liberty to ſee the Monaſtery:</p>
               <p>On the third of <hi>February</hi> as ſoon as we were arrived at the <hi>Yaws,</hi> his Excellence got his Coach ready, and put himſelf immediately into a condition of making his ſolemne Entry into <hi>Moſco.</hi> In the mean time the tediouſneſs of our Journey paſt, the ill lodging we met with in ſo little a Village, and the happy repoſe we promiſed our ſelves in <hi>Moſco,</hi> made us impatiently to expect tho hour of our departure. At length the fifth of that month was appointed for the Ambaſſadors reception, as <hi>Neſtrof</hi> had acquainted his Excellence the day before, adviſing him to have all things ready by nine a clock the next Morning, which according to the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> accompt was the third hour of the day. Accordingly the Liveries were immediately given out to thoſe that were to wear them, and the Gentlemen put themſelves with all ſpeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a very good Equipage, ſo that all were ready at the hour appointed. Our Liveries were ſo rich, and ſo well trim'd, that the Pages Liveries amongſt others coſt near thirty pound ſterling a piece, being almoſt covered quite over with ſilver lace. Each of them had a good plume of feathers in his hat, and in ſhort there was nothing in all this Equipage unworthy the greatneſs of the Maſter. This was in part the condition in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98085:64"/>
which his Excellence was to make his Entry on the 5. of <hi>February,</hi> for which all things were in readineſs by nine of the clock in the morning. But the hour being come we had no Orders for our departure, in ſo much that there we lay languiſhing in a tedious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation till four a clock in the evening. His Excellence having diſpatched his Cooks to <hi>Moſco</hi> in the morning to prepare his dinner in the houſe that was aſſigned him there, we were conſtrained to remain all that day without proviſions, becauſe we expected every moment to be gone. In the mean time no body knew what to make of this dis-order; <hi>Neſtrof</hi> himſelf was amazed and could not imagine the reaſon, unleſs it was that the <hi>Tzar</hi> was a-ſleep, and no body durſt wake him. At length about half an hour before night, the Meſſengers arrived with orders for our departure when we were in deſpair of making our Entry. The Ambaſſador was much ſurpriſed at it, and could not imagine what their deſigne ſhould be to receive him in the night, in ſo much, that he repreſented to <hi>Neſtrof</hi> that it was not the Cuſtome to receive Ambaſſadors in that Manner. However orders being come, and we tyred with an extream impatience all day of removing from thoſe <hi>Wiſbies,</hi> he prepared to depart, and expoſe all his pomp and ſplendor to the darkneſs of the night.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Glory of Princes is in ſome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like the glory of the Sun, and ſuffers its Eclipſes, the diſorders and irregularities of their Officers many times intercepting the rays of their glory. Of this we have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the condition we were in all that day, contrary to the <hi>Tzars</hi> deſigne, who ſtayd near four houres with the Empreſs or great Dutcheſſe at one of the gates of the Town, to ſee the ſplendor of this Embaſſy which was to be more particularly illuſtrious at this Entry. But thoſe who were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of this ſo great miſcarriage, were the cauſe alſo of that which happened after our ſetting forth, and which his Excellence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with great indignation; which was the deferring of our Entry till the next day, after we had advanced a good part of our way, and arrived within ſight of the Town. For it being very late, and the night overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us when as of five <hi>Verſts</hi> we had paſt but two, his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty thought good his Excellence ſhould retire, and ſend orders to <hi>Neſtrof</hi> to conduct him into a little Village on the Left hand, to the end the Ambaſſador might from thence make his Entry the next
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98085:65"/>
morning in good time. We had already in ſome manner preſaged this diſorder when we took notice how we were lead thorough by ways, and that they had by deſigne drawn us out of the high way. For which cauſe the Ambaſſador reflecting upon the ill treatment he had received that day: and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining this delay would become every where a matter of laughter and contempt, he was ſo farr tranſported, that he reſolved and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted not to make his Entry till he had lawfull reparation thereupon. And to teſtify the reſentment he had of this affront, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Trumpets ſhould be ſilent. Thus this day, which ſhould have been a day of Pomp and Magnificence proved a day of faſting of trouble and diſcontent; this day in which his Excellence ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the extraordinarie Markes of the greateſt Amity that ever was betwixt two Crownes, was a day in which he received but the tokens of indignity and contempt. True it is, the Ambaſſador was no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illage,</hi> we were retired to by order from the great <hi>Duke,</hi> but a <hi>Diack</hi> (whoſe name was <hi>Loukian Golozof</hi>) arrived from him to excuſe this diſorder, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he alledged that the Meſſengers that were ſent with the orders for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture had imprudently loſt their way, and that his Majeſty judging it inconvenient his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98085:65"/>
Excellence ſhould make his Entry ſo late, he thought good to defer him till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that he might give him a Reception ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his Character. But the Ambaſſador being aſſured that this wandring of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers was but a pretence (for he was otherwiſe informed, that all this happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not ready to receive him) he was ſo farr from being ſatisfied with his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, that he was diſguſted at the very perſon of the <hi>Diack,</hi> and told him that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reflexion upon him, it had been more becomming to have ſent a perſon of greater quality than he was of, to excuſe ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. In the mean time our Cooks were ſent back, who brought us ſome proviſion along with them, to recover thoſe Spirits we had loſt that day for want of victuals. The next day in the morning his Excellency ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending <hi>Golozof</hi> might have either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guized or concealed his anſwer, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Secretarie to draw up a letter in writing to the <hi>Tzar,</hi> in which he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of the principal circumſtances of this diſorder, and intimate his reſolution not to ſtirr from thence, till ſome correction were given to the Authors and Inſtruments of it. The Letter was in theſe Termes.</p>

                     <p>THis new and unaccuſtomed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of writing to your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſtie, before I have the moſt deſired Honour of being admitted to Your Majeſties preſence, is occaſioned by a misfortune, if not an indignity which hapned to me Yeſterday. After a tedious Journey from <hi>Vologda,</hi> and three Days waiting at the diſtance only of four miles from Your Imperial Court, when I had riſen very early, and according to the advertiſement of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98085:68"/>
                        <hi>Offonarius Evanovitſius Neſtrof,</hi> had fitted my ſelf for my Journey; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, I was conſtrained to languiſh till after Ten without any manner of refreſhment, in the confinement and dirt of a ſmoaky Cottage. All which things, though moſt unworthy the Majeſtie of the King my Maſter, Your Imperial Grandeur, and my particular Character, I patiently ſuſtained with the hope however of Entring Your Imperial City, and approaching the preſence of Your Imperial Majeſtie, and declaring my juſt complaints. At length, when Night was now at hand, notice was given for our ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And after the Guides had, like <hi>Ignes fatui,</hi> miſlead me up and down the Fields, in the Night, it was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to me, that I muſt quarter in this pitiful Village, amidſt all kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, and ſwarms of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Inſects. I confeſs I received from Your Imperial Majeſtie by a certain
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98085:69"/>
Vice-chancellor, a very courteous Meſſage, excuſing the matter, and charging the fault upon the negligence of the Guides and Poſts. I then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, and write the ſame now to Your Imperial Majeſtie, leſt the good man may have forgotten ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the way, That I give Your Imperial Majeſtie very great thanks, and no wiſe doubt of your Generoſity; but that the thing is not of ſo ſmall importance, as to be blown off ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; That the fault proceeded not from the Poſts or Meſſengers, but from others of greater Quality perhaps, though but of equal merit; That affronts done to the Honour of the King my Maſter, Your Imperial Majeſtie, or my ſelf ought not to go unpuniſhed, That the King my Maſter, who is Your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſties higheſt and chiefeſt Friend, gives not ſuch Reception to the Ambaſſadors of Enemies, much leſs to thoſe of Friends; And that in

caſe any ſuch thing ſhould happen in his Kingdom, the King my Maſter would have ſent ſome perſon of the higheſt Nobility to excuſe it (which I ſpeak without reproach to the Vice-chancellor) and not deſiſted till he had expiated ſo barbarous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane an action with the blood of the Criminals, of whatever quality or conſideration; That this proceeding would give cauſe of talk and laughter to the whole World; That therefore, however deſirous I was of approaching of Your Imperial Majeſtie, and ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated in this place; yet I ſhould not ſtir from it till ſatisfaction were given me upon the Perſons of thoſe, who as much as in them lay had vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and affronted the King my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Your Imperial Majeſtie, and the ſacred Character of Ambaſſadors. I have related theſe things to Your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſtie, as they were done and ſpoken; to the end, that You may make
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98085:70"/>
ſuch determination in this moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty buſineſs as ſhall be ſuteable to your Imperial Grandure and Prudence. I have commanded my Interpreter to wait for your Majeſties anſwer in this matter. And I wiſh and imprecate to your Imperial Majeſtie all Happineſs.</p>

               <p>This Letter was ſcarce gone, when <hi>Demente Baſhmacof Diack</hi> of the great Dukes Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, arrived at the Ambaſſadors <hi>Wiſby</hi> from the <hi>Tzar,</hi> he acquitted himſelf of his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to his Excellence ſo well, that having promiſed him all manner of ſatiſfaction, he prevailed with him upon thoſe termes to make his Entry immediately. And as <hi>Baſhma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cof</hi> was returning very well pleaſed, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, who departed with the Letter at the ſame time <hi>Baſhmacof</hi> came to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, arrived with this anſwer, that <hi>Almaze</hi> the <hi>Diacke</hi> of the Embaſſy office (into whoſe hands he had given the Letter) told him that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98085:70"/>
                  <hi>Baſhmacof</hi> was gone towards the Ambaſſador to give him ſatiſfaction in the behalf of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty:</p>
               <p>This being paſt, we departed immediately to make our Entry, in which we received indeed very evident tokens of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of that Prince, there being all the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and glory that precious ſtones, rich furrs, cloth of gold and ſilver, velvets and other rich ſtuffs, goodly horſes, and a noble E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage could make: beſides the noiſe of an incredible number of Trumpets, Kettle-drums and other Inſtruments of military Muſique. ſo that it was reported every where in the court, that the City of <hi>Moſco</hi> never ſaw the Entry of any Ambaſſador ſo glorious as this, which was made, on ſaturday the ſixth of <hi>February</hi> in a very faire day, with the ſame Order and Circumſtances that follow.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors Trumpeters, ſounding their ſilver Trumpets as they went, marcht on horſback in the Van. They were followed by the Gentlemen one after another, every one in his ſledge, the inferior formoſt, ſo that he whoſe place and quality was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the other followed him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly in this proceſſion, to the end that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might have the advantage of being ſo much nearer the perſon of the Ambaſſador. Each of them had his ſledge adorned with Bearſkins ſo diſpoſed, that half of them hung
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98085:71"/>
down behind. The <hi>Priſtafs</hi> domeſtiques followed two and two, all very well clad, and they made five ranks on horſback. After them came the <hi>Priſtafs,</hi> each of them in his ſledge. And my Lord Ambaſſador followed <hi>Neſtrof</hi> in his ſledge drawn by two white horſes, which is the moſt eſteemed colour for horſes in <hi>Moſcovie.</hi> The Tilt or covering of his ſledge was of ſcarlet, whoſe edges hanging down very low were guarded round about with crowns made of little peices of ſky coloured velvet edged with ſilver lace, and the back of his ſledge was dreſt up with the ſkin of a white Bear. On the right ſide of his ſledge upon a plank layd croſs ſate his chief interpreter with his head uncovered, behind there was another board layd at the bottom of the ſledge on which there ſtood two Pages, the twelve footmen in the mean time marching ſix of a ſide with Partiſons trim'd according to their Liveries, one behind another, and all bare. Behind his Excellence followed my Lord <hi>Vicomte Morpeth</hi> the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors only Son then of about ſeventeen years of age, who bare his Father company in all his Embaſſies. He ſate in a very faire glaſs coach drawn by ſix black horſes, with rich houſſes of Scarlet very well laced and fringed with ſilver, which upon black ſhew very handſom, and behind his Coach he had two Pages alſo. After my Lord <hi>Morpeth</hi> came
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98085:71"/>
my Lady Ambaſſadreſs in her <hi>Caftnaz,</hi> covered on the out ſide all over with Crimſon velvet, with very broad laces of gold and ſilver, and lined within with blew damaſke according to the Liveries which were red, lined with blew. On each ſide there were great win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows which ſerved as doors to go in at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, there were little windows alſo, which her Ladiſhip might looke thorow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſeen her ſelfe: ſhe had one of her Gentle-women in the <hi>Caftnaz</hi> with her, two Pages ſtanding upon a plank behinde, and three footmen running by. After my Ladies <hi>Caftnaz</hi> came my Lord of <hi>Morpeths</hi> ſledg, but without any body in it: after which there followed two <hi>Caftnazes</hi> more and ſo in order all the reſt of the train and baggage; which made up about two hundred ſledges.</p>
               <p>A while after we had left this Village, (which was about two a clock) we entred into a very faire champaigne; in which the <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi> horſe were drawne up, and had been two days there putting into Order. Amongſt the reſt they had a great Number of Archers with their Quivers full of arrows; and for their Muſique there were ſo many Trumpets, Kettle-drums, Howboys, and other ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of war, which they had diſperſt in parties thorow all their Troops, that for two miles we were in no want of Muſique. But they having battered our ears with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98085:72"/>
aire above two hours together all the way as we marcht, the noiſe of thoſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which at firſt had delighted us with their melody, became now obſtreperous and troubleſome. In the mean time there were a great number of <hi>Boyars,</hi> of <hi>Stolnicks,</hi> and other perſons of the Court, which came to meet the Ambaſſador, richly clad in Veſts or Tuniques, of cloth of gold and ſilver, or velvets lined with Sables, with great caps on their heads of black Fox, made in the faſhion of a Muff, which they uſe commonly in their Ceremonies. They were moſt of them very well mounted upon good horſes, with rich trappings and bridles of ſilver, made like chains, with the linkes very broad and thin, ſo that whilſt their horſes were in motion, they made a noiſe altogether Majeſtique. There were ſeverall alſo who had their houſſes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with pretious ſtones, whoſe luſtre ſeemed to adde a richer light to the light of the day; and behinde them they had their ſervants carrying covers for their ſadles of Leopard ſkins, cloth of gold, velvet, and ſcarlet. All the Gentlemen of the <hi>Tzars</hi> chamber were there ready to accompany the Ambaſſador to his very houſe.</p>
               <p>At length, the Maſter of the great <hi>Dukes</hi> horſe came to preſent to the Ambaſſador from the <hi>Tzar</hi> a ſledg, &amp; another for my Lord <hi>Morpeth,</hi> with ſeveral white horſes for the Gentlemen.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98085:72"/>
A while after, came <hi>Pronchiſſof,</hi> one of the <hi>Tzars</hi> Counſel, and <hi>Gregory Coſmevitz</hi> along with him, who were both deputed to ſerve his Excellence as <hi>Priſtafs,</hi> or Maſters of the Ceremonies during his reſidence in <hi>Moſco.</hi> And in this occaſion it was we had another ridiculous example of the pride and ruſticity of the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> who are ſo quick and preciſe in anticipating the Prerogative of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors. <hi>Pronchiſſof</hi> being arrived within ſome ſmall diſtance of the Ambaſſadors ſledg, gave him to underſtand that he was ſent to receive him from the grand <hi>Duke</hi> his Lord, and that he expected the Ambaſſador ſhould firſt come out of his ſledg. But his Excellence ſignified to him by his Interpreter, that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations were very ill grounded, that he repreſented the perſon of the King his Maſter, and that in that caſe all ſuch Kind of reſpect was due to himſelf. <hi>Pronchiſſof</hi> however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unmoveable in his ſledg as a Maſter of Ceremonies, and ſent back to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor that he alſo was ſent from the <hi>Tzar</hi> his Maſter to repreſent his perſon: ſo that to have ſeen him, one would have thought he had taken upon him the forme of a ſtatue, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Majeſty of his Prince. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, how abſurd ſoever it was, cauſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſmart replies both on one ſide and the other: till at laſt the Ambaſſador to prevent any further delay in his Entrance, condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98085:73"/>
to this, That they ſhould both of them come out of their ſledges together. But in this <hi>Pronchiſſof</hi> tooke occaſion to deceive his Excellence, and falſify his word, hanging in the aire betwixt the armes of his ſervants, and but touching the earth with his tiptoes, whilſt the Ambaſſador came out freely. At their meeting, they ſaluted one another, and <hi>Pron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſſof</hi> firſt delivered his complement, which conſiſted in declaring his Employment, and acquainting his Excellence, that the <hi>Tzar</hi> had ſent him, and his aſſociate <hi>Gregory Cofmovitz</hi> (who was there preſent alſo) to take care that all things neceſſary ſhould be provided during his continuance at <hi>Moſco.</hi> But the greateſt part of his complement was the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Maſters Titles, which he enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the firſt to the laſt, in a moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and ridiculous maner, as will appeare hereafter. His complement being made, and the Ambaſſador having anſwered him with a very good grace, they retired both of them into their ſledges, <hi>Pronchiſſof</hi> returning in the ſame poſture he came, his ſervants hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him up by his armes, as if they were afraid he ſhould ſinke under the burthen of the emploiment, which his Maſter had given him. At this time <hi>Neſtrof</hi> and <hi>Davidof</hi> (gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving place to <hi>Pronchiſſof</hi> and <hi>Gregory Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitz</hi> the new <hi>Priſtafs</hi>) took their leaves of the Ambaſſador. After which Ceremonies, we
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98085:73"/>
diſpoſed our ſelves to enter into the Town, the Ambaſſador having <hi>Pronchiſſof</hi> on his right hand, and <hi>Coſmovitz</hi> on his left; my Lord <hi>Morpeth</hi> had two Lords of the Court to accompany him; ſo that in every ranke there were three ſledges a breaſt. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were all on horſeback betwixt <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyars,</hi> or Gentlemen of the Court. The Chaplaine, Phyſitian, and Muſique-Maſter, with ſeveral Engliſh Merchants, and two Vallets de Chambre were joyned with them, ſo that they made up about five and twenty ranks on horſe-back, marching three a breaſt.</p>
               <p>All theſe Ceremonies, and the ſlowneſs of our march took up ſo much time, that the night overtook us before we could enter the Town, our frequent ſtoppings and pawſes having conſum'd above three houres in going of about two miles. Therefore, becauſe the Sun had withdrawn himſelf before we were ready to appear in the Town, the Citizens had made great fires in their ſtreets, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided great numbers of torches to render every thing viſible about his Excellence; ſo that the night as well as the day did ſeem to participate in the Glory of this Entry. And the pretious ſtones, darting about the rays of their refulgency, made the clearneſs of the night in ſome reſpect more majeſtique than the brightneſs of the day; not to mention the multitudes of people, wherewith the ſtreets
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98085:74"/>
were filled, and the houſes covered in all places where we paſſed, every one clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring up here and there to behold this Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tzar,</hi> the great Dutcheſs, and the young Princes alſo would needs be Spectators now, as they had diſpoſed themſelves to be the day before. But to the end they might ſee all without being perceived themſelves, they made choice of a place near the Gate of the Brick Wall, whither they had ordered a great number of Wax-tapers to be ſent. And here the <hi>Moſcovian</hi> Trumpets all ſtopt, to ſound at the time as the Ambaſſador paſt the Gate, and was entred into the Town, which was exactly performed: but with ſo confuſed a noiſe, it might very well be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that which the Geeſe made in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Gauls</hi> were climbing over the Walls. After this terrible alarm, which we were altogether ſurpriſed with, under pretence of ſome little accident, they made a ſtop for about half a quarter of an hour, to the end the <hi>Tzar</hi> might at his leiſure obſerve the whole Pomp; and indeed the great number of Wax-Tapers which they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of each ſide of the Gate, diſcovered the deſign clear enough. At length, when his Majeſtie was ſatisfied with viewing the Magnificence of his Excellences Train, he was conducted to the Houſe which they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98085:74"/>
for him, the <hi>Moſcovian</hi> horſe trouping thorough the Town in a huddle, without obſerving any order at all in their march. From the Gate of the Town, we paſt thorow the <hi>Tzars</hi> Guards, which were drawn up on both ſides of the ſtreets, from thence to the Houſe where we lay.</p>

               <head>Of the Ambaſſadors Reſidence at <hi>Moſco.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are three things which principally recommend themſelves to our Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in this place: Our manner of Living whilſt we were here; The Ambaſſadors Negotiation; And ſome Circumſtances that happened during our Reſidence at <hi>Moſco.</hi> Of which City it is neceſſary to give a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Deſcription for the better compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of what followeth.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Moſco</hi> hath the ſame incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience with the other Towns in <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> which is, that it is built like them with Wood, ſome princi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> Houſes excepted. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being paved, they have only great pieces of Firr laid cloſe together, and croſs the Streets. When we were there, its figure was almoſt Circular, and at leaſt four leagues in Cirumference, but being much ſubject to Fire, its form and extent doth not continue long in the ſame condition. True it is, their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98085:75"/>
Streets are broad enough, and from place to place there are certain Intervals left to break off and ceaſe the fury of the Fire, but the materials of their Houſes being ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible, they have much ado to prevent its progreſs. All the remedy they have, is to pull down the Houſes that are next, to the end that by taking away the matter, that ſhould nouriſh it, they may give the flame more room to extinguiſh. But this not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſucceeding, eſpecially if the wind be high, it happens ſometimes, that they ſee a great part of the Town in aſhes in a very ſhort ſpace.</p>
               <p>This Town hath three Walls, one of Brick, another of Stone, a third of Wood, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the four quarters of the Town, which are called <hi>Cataigorod, Tzargorod, Scoradom,</hi> and <hi>Strelitza Sloboda.</hi> The Brick-wall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides <hi>Cataigorod</hi> from the reſt of the Town, that of Stone belongs to <hi>Tzargorod,</hi> and the Wooden one ſerves as Ramparts and Baſtions to <hi>Strelitza Sloboda,</hi> which is properly the quarter of the <hi>Strelitz,</hi> or Muſqueteers of the <hi>Tzars</hi> Guards.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Rivers that paſs by this City, <hi>Moſca</hi> is a fair one, which gives it its Name; it riſes in the Province of <hi>Twere,</hi> and loſeth it ſelf in the <hi>Volga,</hi> where the ſame joines with the River <hi>Occa,</hi> not far from <hi>Columna.</hi> Beſides theſe, there are the <hi>Neglina</hi> and the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98085:75"/>
                  <hi>Yaguſa,</hi> two little Rivers which run by the City, and fall into the River <hi>Moſca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which is the greateſt Ornament to this City, beſides the Rivers I have named, is the great number of Churches and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels which they have there, together with the <hi>Tzars</hi> Caſtle, which is called <hi>Cremelena.</hi> Their Churches are generally of ſtone, arched, &amp; of a round form. They are a great Ornament to the Town, by reaſon of their ſteeples, which are covered over with Lattin, whoſe glittring ſeemes to redouble the brightneſs of the Sun. As to the number of Churches &amp; Chappels in <hi>Moſco,</hi> they are reckoned about two thouſand.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tzars</hi> Caſtle is of that greatneſs, that it is about two miles in Circumference. There is in it a very fair Pallace of Stone, built after the <hi>Italian</hi> faſhion, and another of Wood, which the <hi>Tzar</hi> chuſes to reſide in, as the more healthful of the two. The Patriarch alſo, and ſeveral Boyars have their Houſes of Stone within this Caſtle, beſides two Covents, one of Moncks, and the other of Nuns. There are alſo a great number of Churches and Chappels of Stone, and amongſt the reſt, one dedicated to St. <hi>Michael,</hi> in which the Tombs of the <hi>Tzars</hi> are placed. All the Steeples of theſe Churches are covered with Copper, which the heat of the Sun hath burniſhed into a great reſemblance of Gold; but upon one of theſe Steeples there ſtands
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98085:76"/>
a Croſs which is of maſſie Gold. We ſaw there a Bell (which was made ſome years ſince by a <hi>Moſcovite</hi>) of that prodigious big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that fifty men might very well ſtand within it. It is about nine fathoms in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, which by conſequence is three in diameter. When we came firſt to <hi>Moſco,</hi> it was upon the ground, in a baſe Court where it was caſt, and during the four moneths and a half we remained there, all they could do, was to raiſe it though but a little from the ground, with intention to build a Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for it in the ſame place. The Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Caſtle are alſo very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable: for, beſides that it is very well planted with Canon, there is a large Ditch and three very ſtrong Walls about it. Some of our company that had the curioſity to ſurvey this Ditch, as they paſt over the bridg, were deſired by the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> to march on, and not trouble themſelves with ſurveying their Works.</p>
               <p>There are moreover in <hi>Moſco</hi> a great number of <hi>Greeks,</hi> of <hi>Perſians,</hi> and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of <hi>Tartars,</hi> but they admit no <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> of all Strangers are moſt well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to them, as being in many things conformable with them, but particularly in matters of Religion. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> are well received alſo, and have all of them liberty to hold publique Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98085:76"/>
for the Exerciſe of their Religion, which is not permitted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, for whom they have a particular averſion. But to the end that forreign Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may live together with more liberty, there is a <hi>Sloboda,</hi> or great Suburb without the Town, where moſt of them live, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own way. And in this place it is the <hi>Germans, Engliſh, Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> do moſt commonly reſide.</p>
               <p>The Houſe we were lodged in in this Town, was a large building of Stone, no great diſtance from the Caſtle, and one of the moſt commodious to be found. The Chambers were all arched, every window had its ſhutters of iron, and every paſſage-door was alſo of iron: which gave one occaſion to ſay, we were certainly in the iron Age; though otherwiſe it be a mettle rare enough in that Country. Our Chambers were moſt of them hanged with Serge or red Cloth, and inſtead of chairs, we had benches cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with the ſame ſtuff, without any Beds or other neceſſary accommodations, beſides tables and furnaces for the Winter. Amongſt the reſt of the Rooms, there were two great Hals, one of them (in which the Canopie of State was ſet up) we made uſe of as our Chappel, on thoſe days wherein we had Sermons, of the other for a Quarter for ſeven or eight of our Gentlemen, who
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98085:77"/>
were conſtrained at their arrival, to make their ſeveral lodgings diſtinct from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For when he who had the charge of preparing the Houſe was advertiſed that the Ambaſſador's Gentlemen could not lye crowded together as in a Hoſpital, and that this manner of living would be very ſtrange and incommodious to them; he anſwered jeſtingly, that it was beſt for them to lye together, leſt the Rats ſhould run away with them being ſingle. Which Anſwer put ſome of us on a ſudden upon a deſire to know, if the Rats were ſo big at <hi>Moſco;</hi> for my part I imagined for the doing of ſuch an exploit, every Rat ought to be as big as two <hi>Boyars.</hi> However, we ſaw we had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be impatient at <hi>Vologda,</hi> for our arrival here, where we had all that could be expected in this Country. Our Publique devotion which had been ſuſpended in our Travails, was regulated here as at <hi>Vologda,</hi> and at Eaſter we had a Communion. We had moreover the diverſion of ſeeing the Town, and to viſit our Friends in the <hi>Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boda,</hi> where his Excellence himſelf was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time treated by the Merchants. But this freedom was ſo regulated and reſtrained, that for the four firſt days we were ſhut up cloſe in our Houſe, and not permitted to ſtir abroad before the Audience. They would ſuffer no Strangers to come near us,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98085:77"/>
nor could the Ambaſſador prevail, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants Wives might have acceſs to his Lady. It is true, after the Ambaſſador's Audience we had liberty to go abroad, but then for two or three moneths we were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to take ſome of the <hi>Tzar's</hi> Guards along with us, which followed us armed with their half-pikes; for which end there were commonly fifty of them attending us, keeping their guards at the Gate, and examining almoſt every one that came in. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador himſelf was not permitted to ſtir unleſs he had a <hi>Priſtaf</hi> with him, and was attended with a Company of <hi>Strelits.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it happened, that the Ambaſſador one day after a long expectation of the <hi>Priſtaf</hi> (who ſeemed to neglect him) being upon the point of going abroad in his Coach without him, the footmen running before as if they would have paſſed out of the Gate, the <hi>Strelits</hi> ſtood immediately to their armes, to hinder them, which they did, till the <hi>Priſtaf</hi> was pleaſed to come and accompany the Ambaſſador. None of the <hi>Boyars</hi> could have the ſight of his Excellence in his Houſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he was ſent by the <hi>Tzar,</hi> it being almoſt a Capital offence for any perſon of quality whatſoever, to have any kind of Conference with an Ambaſſador without his leave. Hunting, which was our great divertiſement at <hi>Vologda,</hi> was the leaſt of our recreations

here, but aſſoon as the ſnow was melted, and the ſpring arrived, we fell immediately to making of Horſe-matches. There was a challenge alſo betwixt twelve of our Company to play at Foot-ball. At other times we ran at the Ring, and on that day our repaſt was taken in the Wood, where that exerciſe was performed. Our Muſique-maſter compoſed a handſome Comedie in Proſe, which was acted in our Houſe. As for their Baths, they were as rare at <hi>Moſco</hi> as hunting, for we uſed one as often there as the other. But the moſt part of our Family would go now and then to their publique Stoves, where ſometimes they could ſee a great company of Women naked by the favour of ſome little hole or cleft in the Wall, which ſerved alſo as a paſſage for their immodeſt diſcourſes. About one mile from <hi>Moſco</hi> we obſerved in a little Lake an Iland floting, as the Antients belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of <hi>Delos,</hi> but it was very ſmall. It is kept above water by the roots of Trees, with which it is enterlaced, there were ſome of us took a boat and went upon it, turning it as a piece of timber which way they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>This being, as near as I could relate, the manner of our living at <hi>Moſco,</hi> it follows now that we diſplay the Ambaſſadors negotiation,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98085:78"/>
and at the ſame time the Ceremonies which are practiſed in that Court. In purſuance of which deſign, I ſhall ſpeak in the firſt place of the Audience which the <hi>Tzar</hi> gave the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador on the 11. of <hi>February,</hi> which was five days after our Entry.</p>
               <p>The 7. of <hi>February</hi> which was the next day after we arrived at <hi>Moſco, Pronchiſſof,</hi> and the other <hi>Priſtaf</hi> offered the Ambaſſador Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from the great <hi>Duke</hi> on the ninth of that month, and pretented it as a ſingular favour, that he could have it ſo ſoon; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, the next day they thought fit to delay him two days longer. In which time his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence was deſirous to informe himſelf of all the Ceremonies which were to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, according to the Cuſtome of that Court: and amongſt other things, he demanded of them, whether it were expected that he ſhould be uncovered in the preſence of the <hi>Tzar.</hi> To which they anſwer'd, that the <hi>Tzar's</hi> Ambaſſadors were bare before the King of <hi>England,</hi> and by conſequence that he was to be ſo before his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Ma<hi rend="sup">ty.</hi>. But the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador declared freely to them, that his Maſter the King of <hi>England</hi> had commanded him to be ſo, and for that reaſon he was obliged not to diſpute it: otherwiſe the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>Tzar</hi> could not ſo well repreſent the perſon of their Prince, being but his Slaves, and ſo
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98085:79"/>
ſtiled by him in their very Letters of Credence. After this, he demanded leave to viſit the great Dutcheſs and the young Princes, the eldeſt of which was not above ten years old; but this was refuſed upon this ground, that it was not their cuſtome. Indeed the <hi>Tzars</hi> wives live there very retyred, and his Sons appear not in publique, till they are twelve years old, at which age they ſhow them ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely to the People, and the <hi>Tzar</hi> himſelf is but rarely to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>The Eleaventh day being come, there were a hundred and thirty perſons of the <hi>Tzars</hi> Guards, and threeſcore ſledges ſent to carry the Preſents from the King, the greateſt part of which was deſigned for the <hi>Tzar,</hi> the reſt for the two young Princes <hi>Knetz, Alexcy, Alexevitz,</hi> and <hi>Pheodor Alexevitz</hi> his Sons. But beſides the Kings Preſents to the great <hi>Duke,</hi> there were Preſents alſo from the Queen to the great <hi>Dutcheſs,</hi> and ſome which his Excellence gave the great <hi>Duke</hi> apart as from himſelf. The whole conſiſted in Veſſels of gold and ſilver, in cloth, velvets, ſatins, and damaſke of divers colours; there was alſo great quantities of ſtufs, and table linnen, two gold-watches, three clocks, two pair of Piſtols, one gun, and two carabins, beſides ſix pieces of caſt Canon, a great quantity of <hi>Corniſh</hi> tynne, and a hundred piggs of lead. All which was ſent before to the pallace,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98085:79"/>
the plate being carried by four and twenty men, the cloth by threeſcore, ten men carried the Velvets Sattins and Damaſk, ſix and twenty the ſtufs and table linning, and ten more the Gun, the Piſtols, the Watches, and the Clocks; and on the ſledges they carried the Canon, the Tynne, and the Lead. This being done there were two ſledges brought for the Ambaſſador and my Lord <hi>Morpeth,</hi> and at the ſame time ſeveral white horſes for the Gentlemen of his attendance. At length we began to ſett out about ten a Clock in the morning, the Gentlemen on horſback two and two all richly habited, their hats covered with fair plumes of feathers which did prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally attract the eys of the <hi>Moſcovits,</hi> with whom the ſtreets, the ſhops, the gates and the windows did ſwarme at this time. There were ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants alſo who had joyned themſelves with the Gentlemen, and were fallen into the ſame Order. After them followed my Lord <hi>Morpeth</hi> in his ſledg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Ambaſſadors <hi>Priſtafs</hi> who had brought their rich robes along with them to our houſe, and put them on there. After my Lord <hi>Morpeth</hi> the two Trumpets followed, after them the ſix Pages in three ranks, and after them the twelve footmen marching in the ſame Order as at our Entry. His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was this day in black having on his ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98085:80"/>
had two of the principal <hi>Boyars</hi> in their ſledges as himſelf was, who had put on their robes alſo at our houſe. In the Ambaſſadors ſledg there was the Secretary and the chief Interpreter ſtanding and uncovered, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie carrying in his hands upon a yard of red Damaſke his Letters of Credence written in parchment, whoſe Superſcription con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all the titles of the <hi>Tzar</hi> in letters of Gold. Behind the Ambaſſador there came none but the Maſter of the horſe on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back.</p>
               <p>In this manner we paſt thorow the <hi>Tzars</hi> Guards, who were drawn up in rancks on both ſides of us reaching to the very bottom of the ſtaires of the Hall, thorow which we were to paſs to audience. Near the Caſtlegate we found another regiment of Guards drawn up alſo in very good order. A while after we paſt thorow another Regiment in one of the Courts of the Caſtle, and in this place we ſaw a great number of very fair Canon planted on one ſide and the other with the Canoniers by them, and ready in appearance to fire upon us from all parts. From thence we paſſed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Court filled alſo with Guards, but when we came to the gate of a paſſage thorow which we were to go, all that were in ſladdes or on horſeback alighted. Thoſe who were to go up into the Hall of audience were conſtraind to leave their ſwords behind them, it being not
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98085:80"/>
permitted for any body to paſs any further with them by their ſides, for the prevention of which ceremony, his Excellence and my Lord <hi>Morpeth</hi> carried none with them. When we had gone ſome paces this way (which is a way peculiar to Chriſtian Ambaſſadors, thoſe of Infidel Princes being carried another) there was a <hi>Boyar</hi> came to meet the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor &amp; complemented him from the great <hi>Duke.</hi> From thence we came to a great ſtone Galerie, where another <hi>Boyar</hi> received his Excellence with another complement. And from thence we came into a Hall thorow which we were to paſs in to that of the audience, and here it was we ſaw the Guards of the <hi>Tzars</hi> body in a moſt ſplended Equipage, their Veſts of velvet being lined with ſables, their caps richly adorned with pearles and precious ſtones, and their very Parteſans covered with gold and ſilver. Neare the door of the Hall of audience, the Ambaſſador received a third Complement from the <hi>Tzars</hi> own Couſin. After which we opened to the right and left, and the Ambaſſador entred firſt into the Hall, after him my Lord <hi>Morpeth,</hi> and then the Gentlemen and the Pages.</p>

Which words being with a loud voice explained by his Interpreter which ſtood by his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſide, the Ambaſſador advanced towards the Throne to preſent the Letter which he immediately delivered into the hands of his Chancellor.</p>
               <p>His Excellence returning to his place, the <hi>Tzar</hi> roſe up, and the <hi>Boyars</hi> doing the like all of them at the ſame time, their Veſts of Tiſſue made ſuch a ruffling one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we were ſomething amuzed at the ſuddenneſs of the noiſe. Then after a ſhort ſilence, his Majeſtie began to ſpeak, and to enquire of the Ambaſſador concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings health, but there being a too great diſtance between the <hi>Tzar</hi> and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, the Chancellor had the care of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98085:85"/>
coming to the Ambaſſador, and repeating what the <hi>Tzar</hi> had ſaid. To which the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador returned anſwer in theſe termes. The moſt Serene and moſt Mighty Prince <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, by the Grace of God King of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Defender of the Faith, &amp;c. was through the mercy of the Omnipotent God in perfect health upon the twentieth day of <hi>July,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 1663. when I had laſt the honour to kiſs his Royal hands at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. This anſwer being interpreted to the <hi>Tzar,</hi> He aroſe again, and enquired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Queen Mother in theſe words, How doth the deſolate Widow of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Martyr <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. To which the Ambaſſador having in like manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, began the following Speech, of which he had a Copy in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and his Interpreter another in the <hi>Moſcovian</hi> Language. As he ſpoke it, every period was interpreted apart, ſo that when his Excellence had concluded one Sentence, the intepretation ſucceeded before he began the next, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the propereſt way to entertain their attentions. Therefore the Ambaſſador and his Interpreter were obliged to read from time to time, and to obſerve punctually their ſeveral Periods. This Harangue was alſo tranſlated into <hi>Latine,</hi> of which Tranſlation, becauſe we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak, I ſhall make

                           <p>HIs moſt ſerene Majeſty, my moſt gracious Lord and Maſter, hath lately received from Your Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty a moſt honourable Embaſſage, the ſplendour of which as it was moſt worthy the magnificence of ſo great a Monarch from whom it proceeded, ſo the ſubject was moſt acceptable to Him to whom it was directed. For as much as it contained, together with the moſt welcome news of the health and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of Your Imperial Majeſty, Your joy for His happy Reſtauration to His Kingdoms, your memory of the ancient friendſhip betwixt the glorious Predeceſſors of both your Majeſties and your own moſt conſtant reſolution to continue and increaſe the ſame for the future. So that the ineſtimable worth of your Imperial affection being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98085:91"/>
and ſett of by the honour of ſo conſpicuous an Embaſſie, ſeemed as a Jewel to whoſe value nothing could be added by Nature and Art, hath appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated its utmoſt perfection. Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what the wiſeſt of Princes ſaid concerning a word fitly ſpoken, your ſeaſonable Imperial Meſſage was like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver. One thing onely his moſt Serene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie complaines of, and not without reaſon, that your Imperial Majeſtie hath thereby prevented Him, and whereas he had nothing earlyer in his royal intentions than to have ſaluted you with that ſolemnitie which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the greatneſs of both your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Friendſhip, that he muſt now be the laſt to perform it. Yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, conſidering the parity of your years, the conformity of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and conſequently the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parthy of both your Inclinations, there was herein neither firſt nor laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

you, but in one inſtant the like cauſes muſt in your Princely breaſts have produced the ſame reſolutions. But even the influence of the caeleſtial luminaries, thoſe trueſt Emblemes of Majeſty, is ſuſpended by the various diſpoſition of inferiour bodies and friends, of whom your Majeſties are the beſt pattern, although they think the ſame things could never yet invent ſo punctual an happineſs, as to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change thoſe thoughts at one and the ſame minute. Seing therefore the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention muſt fall on one ſide, his moſt Serene Majeſtie is content that your Imperial Majeſtie hath gained the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of time upon Him, ſo that he may not come behind you as he never will in the truth and ſincerity of his affections. And therefore as is uſual among Friends, he hath thought fit to render you a reaſon of his actions, and to alledge his moſt juſt excuſes, that nothing but the multiplicity of his

Royal domeſtick affaires could have ſo long retarded the honour he receives and paies in ſending to you: That in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this Embaſſage to your Imperial Majeſty he hath poſtponed the return to other Princes nearer to Him, though none have a ſituation cloſer to his heart than your ſelfe, and that he hath been ſo farr from admitting any delay herein, that he hath only watched the moſt proper opportunity to acquit himſelf of ſo due an Obligation. For though his moſt Serene Majeſty conſults not the ſtarrs and the poſition of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens as oft as he would undertake any great action; yet he aſks counſel of him that is the Creator of them and the firſt mover of his felicity. And therefore finding himſelf now ſtated by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Grace and Providence in full fruition of all the bleſſings that can crown a Sovereign head, he hath choſen this as the moſt fortunate hour to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſo great an Emperour, Friend and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98085:93"/>
Brother, and to congratulate and augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to your Imperial Majeſty a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of the ſame, or, if it may be, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er happineſs. For if Victory over Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, obedience of Subjects, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Friends be, as doubtleſs they are, the greateſt ſtrength and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Regal Throne, certainly his moſt ſerene Majeſty having been a miracle of courage and aequanimity in his adverſs fortune is at this day a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er miracle of proſperity. For as for Enemies none hath provoked or tried his power, but thoſe infamous Pirates of Algier, Enemies of Chriſtianity and mankind, whom therefore at two thouſand miles diſtance he blocked up in their own dens, deſtroyed their ſhips, battered their forts, reſcued the captives, and forced thoſe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants to his own conditions. For his ſubjects, they have gladly aſſiſted to the puniſhment of thoſe Traytors and Tyrants, which ſo long oppreſſed and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98085:93"/>
miſled them, and with ſo much more veneration and duty do pay their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage unto their natural moſt Gracious Sovereign, and have with their ancient loyalty waſhed out the ſtaines of the late Rebellion. And for Friends as he hath no Chriſtian Prince at enmity with him, ſo is there ſcarce any of them but have addreſſed themſelves to him by extraordinary Embaſſages, and have upon their deſires been received into his nearer Alliance, Covenanting firſt to deliver up (as they have done) thoſe deteſtable fugitives who were imbrued in the blood of his moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Father. And if after all theſe things there were leiſure to diſcourſe of the largeneſs of his Dominions, he hath to his Hereditarie Kingdoms in Europe, Himſelf added ſeveral Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Aſia, Africa, and America, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond whatever was acquired by his immortal Anceſtors. The Sea is his Bridge betwixt ſo diſtant Territories,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98085:94"/>
and as oft as he pleaſes, his Navies do carry a moveable Frontire to all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable World: ſo that the Fame of his former afflictions hath not been heard ſo farr as his preſent Dominions extend. But though the Extent of Empire be conſonant to the greatneſs of his mind, the Government of ſubjects natural to his Prudence and Juſtice, and Victory over Enemies muſt needs be guſtable to the height of his Courage, yet he, a Prince ſo well exerciſed in the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of humane affaires, could even diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſh Victory, becauſe it taſts of blood, and relax his Government rather than it ſhould oppreſs the liberty of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and looks upon whatſoever Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Dominion, but as a confinement of thoſe more capacious thoughts wherewith he adores the Author of all theſe mercies. Nor values he himſelf therofore ſo much upon all theſe things though in themſelves excellent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, not upon the largeneſs of his
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98085:94"/>
Territories, nor the tranquillity of his Kingdoms, nor the fortunateneſs of his Armes, in compariſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of his Friends. He hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf been faſhioned to it by experience, and is by nature all made up of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Nor ſhould I have made this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective rehearſal of things ſo univerſally known, did not the commemoration of his preſent Greatneſs ſhew him to be the more conſiderable Friend, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the gratitude he profeſſes to thoſe his Friends who formerly made his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity more tolerable, and do now give the trueſt ſeaſon and ſweetneſs to his better fortune. And among all thoſe Friends, who can be preferred, or who indeed is comparable to your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty? For whether his moſt Serene Majeſty conſider the Greatneſs of the Prince, the ancientneſs of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, or freſhneſs of Obligations, what Tree is there that ſpreads a deeper root, or ſheds a greener ſhade, or beares a

Theſe were they that firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the vaſtneſs of the Northern Ocean counted till then unnavigable, who, as the Children of Iſrael with a pillar of fire by night, ſo were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by a pillar of continual day through that wilderneſs of waters unto this your Empire. They may juſtly be ſaid to have invented the true uſe of the load ſtone, and that ſupernatural needle then firſt reſted, at the finding out of your northern principalities, to which it had pointed in vain for ſo many ages. Having eſcaped the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98085:95"/>
of the ſea, they were yet in danger twice to be loſt, firſt in the remaining journy through ſo ſpacious Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and then in the brightneſs of that Majeſty which they expected not out of their own Country. But they were not only refreſhed, as it was ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, by the courteſy of the then Emperour, but received moreover from his munificency, and as a reward of the trade then firſt opened and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced on that ſide of your World, thoſe Immunities and priviledges from which thence forward both the Nations have reaped no ſmall Advantage. And ever ſince a moſt ſincere and hereditary Amity hath been tranſmitted between the Succeſſors of both Princes from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Son, unto your Majeſties now reigning. 'Twas much about that time that other Princes had ſent out their Navies likewiſe for new diſcoveries. The <hi>Portuguez</hi> found out and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> the Land of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98085:96"/>
pearls and ſpices, though none ſo orient or fragrant as what his preſent Majeſty of <hi>Portugal</hi> hath depoſited by the ſide of my moſt Serene Lord and Maſter. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> ſeized upon the mines of Gold and Silver. So that when nothing of value ſeemed left for the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> they found what was more adequate to the deſires of Princes who neither needed nor co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted further Empire, a Friend. And his moſt Serene Majeſty is wont to ſay that his was the beſt lot of the three, and that he would not change his Friend of an hundred years for the Treaſure of both the <hi>Indies.</hi> And He adds for reaſon his own Experiment, foraſmuch as when his Subjects were generally revolted. His Friends as it is uſual moſt of them failed, and when it ſeemed that Heaven and Earth had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired his ruine while they were but contriving his happineſs, He was then not only readily aſſiſted by your Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98085:96"/>
Majeſty but the addreſſes of the Uſurpers rejected, and your protection withdrawn from all who might ſeem any way tainted with the infection of that diſloyaltie. And therefore his moſt Serene Majeſty, as he hath readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed into the hands of your Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Ambaſſador thoſe ſums with which you did then pleaſure him, ſo will he always retain depoſited in the moſt ſacred receſs of his Royal heart, and tranſmit to his Succeſſors the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of all theſe Obligations. And for all theſe new cauſes, and upon thoſe good and auncient grounds, his moſt Serene Majeſty declares in your own Imperial words, than which none could be either more ſignificant in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or more conſonant to his ſenſe, <hi>That his moſt Serene Majeſty taking into conſideration the flouriſhing eſtate of his Kingdomes, &amp; that intire brotherly love and amity and frequent correſpondency which was inviolable held, and continued

                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:98085:99"/>My Lord Ambaſſador having made an end of his ſpeech, which was well approved of, His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie told him that he would do him the honor to let him kiſſe His hand: therefore he went up again to the Throne and kiſſed His hand, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of Chriſtian Ambaſſadors. For it is a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie that they muſt be ſubject to in this Court, though indeed it is a thing much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the dignity of an Ambaſſador, who under that Character ſhould rather keep themſelves equal with the Princes Majeſtie than to condeſcend to ſuch a low ſubmiſſion. Nor do I doubt but that my Lord Ambaſſador had rather accepted of ſuch a condition as they put to Infidels Ambaſſadors who are not admitted to the performance of this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, becauſe the <hi>Tzar</hi> counts it a great favour, and therefore He does reſerve it only for Chriſtians. He did alſo the ſame honour to my Lord his Gentlemen, who all kiſſed his hand decently and in good order, while his Excellency ſate upon a forme that his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie Himſelf called for to that purpoſe. The mean while there was a <hi>Boyar</hi> to uphold the <hi>Tzars</hi> right hand that was kiſſed leſt He ſhould come to be tired, and with the left hand He held His heavy Scepter. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture my Lord recommanded from the King to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie Sir <hi>John Hebdon,</hi> who was come along with my Lord from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:98085:99"/>
where he had been of late his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties Agent. And therefore, becauſe being in that employment he had beſtowed a great care and prudence in promoting the common good of both Crowns. His Majeſtie thought fit to acquaint upon this occaſion his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie with the ſingular eſteem He had for his perſon. Theſe are the words my Lord ſpoke in the ſaid Knights behalf as he was ſtepping next to my Lord of <hi>Morpeth</hi> to kiſſe the <hi>Tzars</hi> hand, <hi>This Gentleman</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>is I ſuppoſe well known to Your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſtie: He hath done Your Imperial Majeſtie very good ſervice in the Court of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and therefore his Majeſtie hath a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular eſteeme for him, and has commanded me to recommend him more particularly when I ſhall next have the honour to be admitted to Your Imperial preſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gentlemen having all kiſſed the <hi>Tzars</hi> hand, the Preſents that were ſent by the hundred and thirty men came in and paſſed in very good order on one ſide of the great pillar, and ſo went about into a room next to the hall. Thereupon my Lord Ambaſſador ſtood up and ſaid to his Majeſtie; <hi>His moſt Sè<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Majeſtie hath ſent a Preſent as a token of His affection to Your Imperial Majeſtie, which whatsoever it is, the value thereof will be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by the kind acceptance of Your Imperial Majeſtie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:98085:100"/>The Firſt thing that came in was a Gun of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and therefore his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie preſented it with this Compliment; <hi>This</hi> Gun <hi>was delivered to me by his Majeſties own hand, being excellent in its kind, the ſame which his Royal Father of bleſſed and glorious memorie uſed to ſhoot in, and which as a Relique of that renowned Prince he thought could not be better dedicated than to the hands of Your Imperial Majestie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next to the <hi>Gun</hi> came a paire of Piſtolets, whereupon my Lord ſpoke again, <hi>That pair of Piſtolets (ſaith he) his Majeſtie delivered me alſo with his own hand, commanding me to excuſe their oldneſs, which he thought would not make them leſs acceptable, when You knew they where thoſe, with which after ſo long ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, He rid in His triumphant Entry into His Metropolitan City of London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Plate came next to thoſe Piſtolets, and in the firſt place a great ſilver-guilt Baſin ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported upon two mens armes, ſo all the reſt paſſed by without ſtopping, next to the <hi>Tzars</hi> the preſents allowed for the two Princes, then the Queenes preſent to the Dutcheſs, and at laſt my Lord Ambaſſadors.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the Audience, and my Lord being brought home was treated (as it is uſual in that Court at Audience-daies) with the <hi>Tzars</hi> own meat, and it was therefore ſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently from the Palace. There was about an
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98085:100"/>
hundred diſhes brought publickly in order, with good ſtore of wine, brandy, and meade; His Majeſtie ſent alſo one private <hi>Boyar</hi> to take a care of all the Ceremonies that were to be obſerved: but the greateſt Ceremonie being to drink many healths, he made ſure to have every health written in a bill in the ſame order as the <hi>Tzar</hi> had appointed him. His Excellency ſate at the middle of the table upon his chair of State, at his right hand was my Lord of <hi>Morpeth,</hi> and at his left Sir <hi>John Hebdon,</hi> both at each end of the table, ſo that they were prettie diſtant from my Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador: the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> ſate together at the other ſide of the table which was ſquare and croſswiſe ſet. My Lord having furniſhed his own plates, took occaſion to make uſe himſelf alone of a dozain of ſilver-guilt plates he had, but the <hi>Boyars</hi> not liking that Ceremonie ſeemed to look upon it with a jealous eye: yet his Excellency kept them as cheerful as he could, both by his graceful preſence of ſpirit and the ſweetneſs of his Muſick. The <hi>Boyar</hi> who directed the feaſt did alſo play his part with his healths, holding the paper in his hand, and preſently begun his great Lords good health; Though indeed I think he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked farr better the King of <hi>Englands,</hi> for my Lord Ambaſſador preſented him with the cup wherein he drunk it being of ſilver-guilt, wherewith he was ſo much taken that he
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98085:101"/>
ſcarce minded any thing elſe and ſo went away with it.</p>
               <p>The 13. of <hi>February,</hi> my Lord had again Audience of the <hi>Tzar,</hi> and alſo his firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the Commiſſioners appointed by his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie. We went in the ſame order and manner as we did the firſt time, but my Lord Ambaſſador was led into another hall much handſomer than the firſt, the inner-roof being fairely guilt with very good pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, there were alſo fair windows and very rich tapeſtrie. The <hi>Tzar</hi> was upon a little Throne not above two ſteps over the ground, yet having ſtill the Crown upon his head and the Scepter in his hand, and at his right hand there was the Imperial <hi>Globe.</hi> This Audience being a little private, and therefore not ſo copious of <hi>Boyars,</hi> the <hi>Tzar</hi> inquired of the Ambaſſadors health, and told him beſides, that having cauſed the Kings Letter to be tranſlated he knew thereby his Majeſties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and that conſequently he had appointed ſix Commiſſioners amongſt his near <hi>Boyars</hi> and <hi>Counſellors</hi> to treat with him about his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. So my Lord did not ſtay with the <hi>Tzar</hi> above a quarter of an hour, then he ſtood very near to him, but ſtill with his hat off.</p>
               <p>While he was going to the room appointed for the Conference, he was met twice by ſome of their <hi>Boyars</hi> wearing great gold chaines about them, which I thought to be ſomething
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98085:101"/>
like thoſe <hi>Aethiopian</hi> ſlaves whoſe chaines were alſo of gold. My Lord being come to the room, he and his Commiſſioners ſate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he delivered them one paper about the Reparation promiſed in his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties name before he made his Entrance, and another concerning the Reſtitution of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges enjoyed formerly by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.

               <p>The 17. my Lord Ambaſſador had another Conference in the Pallace, where his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners read to him their anſwer to his two papers, but refuſed to give him yet a Copy of it. In that anſwer all things were quite contrary to his expectations, ſo that he thought fit thereupon to ſpeak ſomewhat hard to them. Then it happened that one great caſement of the room, wherein they were aſſembled together, fell down with ſuch a horrid noiſe, that the Lords Commiſſioners were quite aſtoniſhed, and wiſhed my Lord had ſpoken more gently. An Interpreter of theirs, who was an outlandiſh man, ſpeaking afterwards to that purpoſe ſaid, <hi>If</hi> (ſaith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:98085:105"/>The 26. <hi>Pronchiſſof</hi> brought my Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador a Copy of their anſwer read to him the ſeventeenth. But leſt I ſhould tire the Reader with an ill compacted diſcourſe, whoſe ſtile and meaning are equally rude and unpleaſant, I ſhall only tell the ſubſtance of it in as few words as I can. And firſt, as to the Reparation demanded by my Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in his firſt paper of 13. of <hi>February,</hi> they ſay (when they have much extolled the greatneſs of the pomp that was ſhewn at his Reception, which they take to be the moſt glorious that ever was made in their Court to any Ambaſſador) that the diſorder afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid happened upon the miſtake of the Poſts. That it was not fit he ſhould make his Entry by night, and that his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie had therefore given order that he ſhould lodge that night nearer <hi>Moſco,</hi> ſo that the next day he might be received betimes with a ſplendor anſwerable to his quality; And ſo, that ſo many ſtrangers who lived in <hi>Moſco</hi> might ſee by this Reception, how great is the Amity which their Great Lord beares to his Majeſtie, and that they might diſcourſe of it in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Countries. But to that they added a thing that ſurpriſed very much his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, ſaying, that he himſelf ſtaied alſo a great while the next day, after many Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were ſent unto him. And preſently after they make bold to tell him, that he ought
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98085:105"/>
not to have demanded ſatisfaction in that place, where then he was. And at laſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other proofs they only ſay; that thoſe Meſſengers who accidentally miſſed their way the firſt day had been chaſtiſed.</p>
               <p>Their anſwer to the ſecond Paper concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Priviledges of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company was no leſs unreaſonable, they refuſed them under the following pretences, which they alledge for good and ſolid reaſons. Firſt of all they ſay, the Priviledges were aboliſhed upon occaſion of the late Rebellion of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company of <hi>Archangel</hi> was guilty of it. Then they ſpeak of one <hi>Luke Nightingale</hi> whom they affirm to have been ſent ſecretly to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie by the late Kings Majeſtie during the Rebellion, to give Him notice of it, and to deſire Him to abrogate the Priviledges of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, as having alſo put off their Obedience; Adding moreover, that this ſame <hi>Nightingale</hi> had Letters from the King, that he was very private with his Royal Majeſtie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon they ſay, that <hi>John Hebdon</hi> (ſo they call the Knight that I mentioned before) was Factor to this ſame <hi>Cartwrite.</hi> Afterwards they lay an hainous charge againſt the ſaid Company; as, that they had not furniſhed the <hi>Tzars</hi> treaſury with their commodities, at the ſame price they were ſold for in <hi>England,</hi> that they had ſold prohibited commodities as Tobacco, and that beſides they offered to take ſtrangers goods to carry them through the Country cuſtome free. Laſtly they ſpeak of a general complaint made by the <hi>Ruſſes,</hi> Merchants and Tradeſmen, as if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants had all the trade themſelves, and grew thereby very rich in a ſhort time, whereas his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties Subjects grew poorer every day. They alleadge alſo that the Merchants who were firſt nominated for the Priviledges were dead, ſo that (it ſeemes) they will have the Priviledges to dy with them.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98085:107"/>
did really intend to reflect upon me that day all the Honour which according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of his Court is due to the Character I bring from my Royal Maſter. So that there ſeemes to be much more in it than an accident, &amp; eſpecially ſeeing that Perſons ſent that ſame day to the ſame place upon an incivility to Sir <hi>John Hebdon,</hi> a Gentleman of his Majeſties privy Chamber, and of my Train, could finde the way early in the morning; but thoſe that were ſent about my Reception, did miſs it till night. And therefore, becauſe ſo many Strangers of ſeveral Nations, which dwell in his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> City, were wineſſes that day of ſuch miſcarriage, contrary to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie, as no age nor no Nation can paralel, and that they have, and do, and will diſcourſe of it according to their own apprehenſions, both here and in their ſeveral Countries, neither to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the King my Maſter, nor yet of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie, unleſs His prudence may appear in his Juſtice. Therefore I ſay, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what is in my firſt paper mentioned. But inſtead thereof I am told in this paper delivered to me the 26. of <hi>February,</hi> that the next day after, many Meſſengers being ſent unto me, I alſo ſtayed late; To which I reply, that it is very poſſible that many Meſſengers were ſent to me that day, and that they loſt their way then as the others the day before:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98085:108"/>
And indeed in the place where I was it was yet difficulter to finde me, eſpecially ſeeing it appeares the nearer one comes to <hi>Moſco</hi> men are more ignorant of the Roads. But the firſt meſſage that I received that day was by a very conſiderable Perſon the <hi>Diack</hi> of the Imperial Cabinet, and aſſoon as we had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken together and he promiſed me ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which if I ought not to have aſked, he ought not to have promiſed; but being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ought to be effected: I was ready in a quarter of an hour, though it was then not two a clock after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> account, and I but at two <hi>Verſts</hi> diſtance; which indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportions of the former day, made me ſuſpect, as alſo it proved, that by how much I was yet nearer I ſhould come in ſo much later to <hi>Moſco.</hi> However though I could have wiſhed to have entered by day, as indeed it was fitting, and might perhaps the third day have ſucceeded, yet out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I took my chance of the night. And what I diſcerned before it was dark of the the Honour his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty intended, and did me, joyned with thoſe moſt friendly and cordial Sentiments, which I brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Him from my Royal Maſter, made me interpret that very obſcurity for ſplendour, and that moſt Serene night which brought me ſo near his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, was by me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred

before the moſt Illuſtrious day that had detained me from Him. But whereas it is ſaid, that I ought not in that place to have demanded an anſwer of my being hindered the former day; After having firſt proteſted, that whatſoever I have ſaid above in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to my ſelf, upon the ſecond day, hath not been upon any account or obligation that I have or ought of anſwering any charge, accuſation, or recrimination againſt me; but only out of the deſire that I have by all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable means to retain the good opinion of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, as being ſo great a Prince and Friend of the King my Maſter, and which I have neither forfeited yet, and may poſſibly deſerve further before my going away (unleſs upon ſome unhappy interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from other perſons:) I add next, that none but the King my Maſter knowes what I ought to have done, and therefore I deſire that all expreſſions to the contrary may be omitted for the future. But if upon promiſe from ſo conſiderable a perſon as the <hi>Diack</hi> of the <hi>Tzarkoy</hi> Cabinet, I did enter this City, and if upon the faireſt hopes given me by his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie's <hi>Boyars</hi> and Counſellors, I leaving it upon the honour of ſo worthy perſons, I have paſſed from this Complaint in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to His Majeſtie's other buſineſs, and that no redreſs be given me, then indeed I have done what I ought not. And that ſuch redreſs
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98085:109"/>
hath as yet not been given me I muſt affirm, ſeeing all that is ſaid tending thereto is, that in the meeting of me the height of Honour was ſhewn me, which is nothing, if in not meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of me, the day before, there was ſhewed me all Diſhonour. For the actions of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty are all equal, and of one thread; and ſo magnanimous a Prince is far from being ſo ſtraitned and neceſſitated in courteſy, that to make that Courteſy appear the higher, He muſt do a Diſcourteſy the day before. And then to ſay, that thoſe by whom the delay was cauſed have been puniſhed, I appeal to your ſelves, whether if mine were your own caſe, you would think ſo ſlender and tranſitory an account, a ſufficient ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, or a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent diſcharge for your ſelves. And therefore I inſiſt upon my demands, as they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in my former Paper of the thirteenth of <hi>February.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus my Lord anſwered to their Excuſes concerning the Hinderance of his Entry the firſt day. Now he comes to the ſecond part of their anſwer concerning the Privileges, and indeed he does ſo diſcuſs and refute their Objections alledged againſt the granting of them, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be ſaid more juſt and reaſonable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, ſayes he, as to the ſending the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Merchants out of the <hi>Moſcovian</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and whatſoever paſſed either in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98085:109"/>
or in ſecret in any year in relation to thoſe affairs, is perfectly known to his Majeſtie my Maſter; who hath choſen to interpret it all to the beſt advantage, and accordingly both at Council before the King my Maſter, as alſo here in publick, I have ſtill mentioned it with honour to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie. Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as, though all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the calamitie of that Rebellion, but the better part alwayes free from the guilt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> here did generally put on mourning out of their abhorrence and grief for that deteſtable Parricide, and though moſt of them had from the Lord <hi>Culpepper</hi> his Majeſties Ambaſſador in this Court teſtimonie under his hand and ſeale of their fidelitie to his Majeſtie (which they alſo witneſſed by conſiderable ſummes of mony furniſhed at that time by them for the ſervice of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie to the ſaid Ambaſſador) nevertheleſs his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie might very well not be informed of the ſaid particulars; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though he ſent the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of the <hi>Moſcovian</hi> Dominions, and ſeized upon their houſes, and commanded in their bonds and bills which they had upon <hi>Ruſſes,</hi> yet did therein a generous and moſt obliging act to the King my Maſter; Eſpecially if, as followes in the anſwer of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie near <hi>Boyars</hi> and Counſellors, there came from his Majeſties Father of ever bleſſed memory <hi>Luke
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98085:110"/>
Nightingale</hi> and as follows in the ſaid <hi>Boyars</hi> and Counſellors narrative thereof before recited.</p>
               <p>But neither did the ſame <hi>Luke Nightingale</hi> come with his Majeſties Letters privately: For what Letter he brought was very publick, being without a ſeale or open, neither was that Letter from his Majeſtie, as will appeare if the near <hi>Boyars</hi> and Counſellors of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie produce that Letter they mention, which in the name of the King my Maſter I deſire may be done. And whereas the ſaid near <hi>Boyars</hi> and Counſellors ſay the ſaid <hi>Luke</hi> was always about his Royal Majeſtie without going from Him; to the contrarie his Majeſtie never knew ſuch a perſon or heard of him before his crimes in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Luke Nightingale</hi> being a broken merchant, a perjured fellow, and a groſſe Impoſter. Which will further appeare, if the ſaid his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty near <hi>Boyars</hi> and Counſellors will be pleaſed to remember, that his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie in a Letter dated <hi>July</hi> 11. 7155. to his Royal Majeſties Father of ever bleſſed memorie did make the ſame relation which his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties <hi>Boyars</hi> and Counſellors do now make of the ſaid <hi>Nightingale,</hi> and to compare with that what I now offer them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to me by his Majeſties command out of the Secretarie of States office, being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of his Majeſties Royal Father of ever
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98085:110"/>
bleſſed memorie, His anſwer to the ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which having been prepared ready could not by reaſon of his death ſhortly ſucceeding be ſent over; [<hi>Laſtly whereas Your Imperial Majeſtie hath intimated that one</hi> Luke Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingale <hi>hath preſumed to treat with Your Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Majeſtie in Our name, and to preſent a writing in Your Majeſties Office, we therefore finding our ſelves much diſhonoured thereby deſire a Copy of the ſaid writing, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon when he ſhall repaire into Our juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, we may according to juſtice proceed againſt him as a perſon abuſing our name, and treating without our Royal Commiſſion and order in propounding matters repugnant to our Royal intentions</hi> 1648.] And though the fellow be ſince dead, and hath eſcaped ſo the juſtice of the King my Maſter, yet in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties name I deſire the letter may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into my hands, as alſo that I may know with what <hi>Boyars</hi> he treated or writ or ſpoke in that matter; that by what they remember of the matter I may give his Majeſtie more perfect information thereof. And, though by what appeares already whatſoever he hath ſaid here of that nature is moſt falſe, and not to be valued any further by any perſon of honor and underſtanding, yet can I not omit what upon his account his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties near <hi>Boyars</hi> add concerning Sir <hi>John Hebdon.</hi> For I cannot comprehend to what purpoſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98085:111"/>
he is mentioned in this place, the ſaid Sir <hi>John Hebdon</hi> being ten years before free from the Service of <hi>Cartwrite,</hi> and being he who procured the remanding of <hi>Nightingale</hi> from <hi>Novogorod</hi> and his detaining here ſome time, till he got away as privately as he came, and never daring to repaire to the ſight of his late Majeſtie of ever bleſſed memorie, or of his Majeſtie now reigning, dyed like a villain at <hi>Riga.</hi> But indeed the near <hi>Boyars</hi> and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors did very prudently, when upon their urging this matter upon me as a truth and realitie, they made difficulty to admit the ſaid Sir <hi>John Hebdon,</hi> though then required by me according to the deſire of his Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, and though at the ſame time Forainers were all the while preſent to ſpie and obſerve my diſcourſe concerning his Majeſties affaires. For they could not be ignorant that Sir <hi>John Hebdon</hi> was able to give a pertinent account of all the Impoſtures of the ſaid <hi>Nightingale,</hi> and in two minutes to have diſcovered the nakedneſs of all that falſhood, which for want of Audience all this time has gone cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent for a truth of great authority. And as for that <hi>Cartwrite,</hi> if being oppreſt by ſome of the late <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie of ever glorious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie His Miniſters, he ſought abroad any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration contrary to his late Majeſties of ever bleſſed memorie will or knowlege, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay for him at this time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:98085:111"/>But, whereas the ſaid near <hi>Boyars</hi> and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, paſſing from that reaſon of taking away the Privileges upon occaſion of the late Rebellion, are pleaſed to alledge ſeveral Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> here in their way of trading in this Country, I confeſs it is ſome thing new to me. And it ſeemes thereby to appeare (which I am unwilling to believe) as if the ſaid <hi>Boyars</hi> knew ſome other reaſons than his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties generous reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the injuries and inhumanities done to his late Majeſtie of ever bleſſed memorie for the taking away thoſe Privileges. Which being ſo contrary to what the King my Maſter hath always believed, and that from ſeveral expreſſions in his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I am therefore the leſſe prepared to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Yet thus much I ſhall ſay, after minding the ſaid near <hi>Boyars</hi> and Counſellors of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie, that their allegations had been more weighty, had they named the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons guilty of ſuch miſcarriages; as firſt to their not furniſhing of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Treaſury, wherewith they are charged. The Merchants have from time all along, yea to the very time of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties taking away of their Privileges, furniſht his Treaſury with Cloth, Tyn, Lead, Pewter, and all other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the growth and manufacture of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at prices farr cheaper than the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Hamburghers</hi> did or could deliver them, if
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98085:112"/>
their Commodities were anſwerable to thoſe furniſht by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And it is affirmed by the Company of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, that their Servants and Factors have at ſeveral times of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to deliver goods into his Majeſties Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury at the prices they coſt there in <hi>England,</hi> but they would not be accepted. And when they have been accepted or received into his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Treaſury, the Factors here could very ſeldome or never get their monies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great bribes to his Officers, nay ſeveral of them could never get any thing for their goods ſo delivered. And the ſaid Merchants do and can juſtly affirme that his Treaſury hath not ſuffered in that particular, but that they have been much ſufferers in what they have delivered for want of good payment. As to their dealing with Tobacco, the Companies care and orders were ſuch (each member being under an oath to obſerve the ſame) that if any man trading under the Privileges were known or found to have any, it was preſently taken and burnt before the <hi>Ruſſes</hi> his Subjects, whereof many preſidents may be produced. So that in this particular of what is ſaid there is nothing proved, no not ſo much as any one inſtance of any one member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany trading here under the Privileges. As to buying of ſtrangers Commodities, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants privileged here, have ever been ſo farr from dealing in prohibited Commodities, as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98085:112"/>
alſo from taking or meddling with any ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers goods to carry them from Archangel to <hi>Moſcow</hi> cuſtome-free, and ſo defraud his Majeſtie of his cuſtomes, that they have from time to time made very ſtrict orders to the contrary. So that if any perſon were found faulty in that particular, he ſhould be delivered to the Emperors laws and not be protected by the Agent or Company there reſiding. Nay further of late years the Company have been ſo fearful to offend in colouring ſtrangers goods, that they have made ſtrict orders to prohibit all trade with the <hi>Dutch, Hamburg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers,</hi> or any other ſtrangers, either at <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel</hi> or any other place in his Dominions.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt Merchants being dead, It was never underſtood (as farr as I know) by the <hi>Tzar</hi> his Predeceſſors here, nor (I am ſure) by the Kings of <hi>England</hi> there (who by their Ambaſſadors capitulated and made agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in which the Companies Privileges were included) that thoſe Privileges were made only to particular and individual men, and that when thoſe men ſhould dy, the Privileges ſhould ceaſe and dye with them. For it was then underſtood that the Privileges granted was a due to the Nation; and not only thoſe men which were then nominated, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to thoſe who ſhould ſucceed them in the trade.</p>
               <p>And for what belongs the Petition of the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98085:113"/>
                  <hi>Goeſs</hi> and all other Tradeſmen of the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Dominions, and all the pretences which are hudled together againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; I ſhall only ſay at preſent that it ſeemes natural enough to me that the <hi>Goſes,</hi> a ſmall number of perſons, might deſire thereby to ingroſs the whole trading to their own hand, though to the prejudice of the generalitie of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties ſubjects. But that the whole Tradeſmen of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> who receive great advantage from the traffick with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſhould in that manner petition, ſeemes not ſo probable becauſe leſs reaſonable.</p>
               <p>Therefore paſſing over all ſuch colours or realities, which may eaſily be diſcuſſed in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Conferences, unleſs this new and abrupt anſwer ſhall give me occaſion wholly to give over the buſineſs, I ſhall my ſelf ſay roundly (inviting thereby the near <hi>Boyars</hi> and Counſellors of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie to the ſame way of proceeding) that if the Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were only taken away upon occaſion of the late Rebellion and the Impoſtures of <hi>Luke Nightingale,</hi> as hath been given to underſtand to the King my Maſter, that therefore the ſame Impoſtures being now diſcovered, and the ſaid Rebellion being extinguiſhed and pardoned, and his Majeſtie now deſiring by me that they may be reſtored again; It is now therefore time for his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſtie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to redouble the former obligation upon
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98085:113"/>
the King my Maſter. But if theſe other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences were the ſole or the concurrent reaſons of their taking away, His Majeſtie is ready by me both to invigorate the execution of any good orders formerly made for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the like miſcarriages, and alſo to make for the future ſuch further proviſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, as may ſecure the intereſt of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty and Subjects. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore however the King my Maſter deſireth that before all things the ſaid Privileges may be revived, not that thereby there is any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage or gain to his Royal Majeſty, who could willingly ſhoot away yearly as much powder as the value of them comes to at the health of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty his dear and loving Brother. Nor that the Merchants his Subjects have thereby (as is alleged) ſo inricht themſelves in any compariſon with what the Subjects of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty have reaped this hundred years from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade. For on the contrary the <hi>Engliſh</hi> merchants have in their free way of living and expenſe in the Country rather ſtrove to defray only and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the friendſhip with the inhabitans than to accumulate wealth to themſelves; Which yet if they had done they could not be envyed nor ought to be reproached therewith by thoſe, whoſe Country hath by their benefit drawn in the Commerce and riches of all <hi>Europe.</hi> Nor yet that his Majeſty expects herein, as it
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98085:114"/>
were, a recompenſe of all thoſe other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations which their <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty have received upon ſeveral emergencies of State from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> his Majeſty being diſpoſed rather to continue and increaſe all ſuch Obligations than to call them in, and diminiſh them by any exprobration or demand upon His ſide. But, to tell you the upright truth as it is fit for us to do with one another, his Majeſty conſiders that theſe Privileges were the ancient and continued foundations of Amity, and tranſmitted ſo long from Father to Son on both ſides: ſo that as men prize a token and memorial of a friend (though otherwiſe of ſmall value) above pearls and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds he counts it a kind of unlucky thing to loſe them. Alſo He himſelf and all his Subjects upon his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties Letter of <hi>July</hi> 28. 1661. (where He ſaith, <hi>Whereas Your Majeſty writt in Your ſaid Letter concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning other affairs, in proſecution of which Your Majeſty would ſend to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s our Tzarskoy Majeſty Your Subjects the Merchants together with Your Majeſties Ambaſſador, who ſhall further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the affection of friendſhip which Your Majeſty Our loving Brother hath towards Our Tzarskoy Majeſty; we anſwer that when to Our Imperial Majesty Your Majesties ſaid Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor ſhall arrive and ſhall declare to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he hath from Your Majeſty Our Brother, we Our Tzarskoy Majeſty will be ready, ſo farr

Offonaſsy Pronchiſſof,</hi> I delivered it to him, not being a paper of State, nor written in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language wherein I treat, nor put into the hands of the near <hi>Boyars</hi> and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> majeſty, nor ſubſcribed by my ſelf, nor tranſlated into <hi>Ruſſe</hi> by my Interpreter, but only as a piece of curioſity, which is now reſtored me and I am poſſeſſed of it; ſo that herein his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> majeſties near <hi>Boyars</hi> and Councellors are doubtleſs ill grounded. But again I ſay concerning the value of the words <hi>Illuſtriſſimus</hi> and <hi>Sereniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus</hi> compared together, ſeeing we muſt here from affaires of State, fall into Grammatical conteſts concerning the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue; that the word <hi>Serenus</hi> ſignifieth nothing but ſtill and calm; and therefore though of late times adopted into the Titles of great Princes by reaſon of that benigne tranquillity which properly dwells in the majeſtick countenance of great Princes, and that venerable ſtillneſs of all the Attendants that ſurround them, of which I have ſeen an excellent example when I was in the preſence of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> majeſty, yet is more properly uſed concerning the calmneſs of the weather, or ſeaſon. So that even the night is elegantly called <hi>Serene</hi> by the beſt Authors, <hi>Cicero</hi> in <hi>Arato</hi> 12. <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> l. 1.29. <hi>Serena nox,</hi> and upon peruſing again what I have writ in this paper, I finde that I have out of the cuſtomarineſs of that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98085:117"/>
expreſſion my ſelf near the beginning ſaid, <hi>And that moſt ſerene night, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas on the contrary <hi>Illuſtris</hi> in its proper derivation and ſignification expreſſeth that which is all reſplendent lightſome and glorious as well without as within, and that not with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary but with a primitive and original light. For if the Sun be, as he is, the firſt fountain of light, and Poêts in their expreſſions (as is well known) are higher by much than thoſe that write in Proſe, what elſe is it when <hi>Ovid</hi> in the 2. of the <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> ſaith of <hi>Phoebus</hi> ſpeaking with <hi>Phaêthon, Qui terque quaterque concutiens Illuſtre caput,</hi> and the <hi>Latin</hi> Orators, as <hi>Pliny</hi> Ep. 139. When they would ſay the higheſt thing that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt upon any ſubject, word it thus, <hi>Nihil Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrius dicere poſſum.</hi> So that hereby may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties near <hi>Boyars</hi> and Counſellors what diminution there is to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty (which farr be it from my thoughts) if I appropriate <hi>Sereniſſimus</hi> to my Maſter and <hi>Illuſtriſſimus</hi> to Him than which <hi>nihil dici poteſt Illuſtrius.</hi> But becauſe this was in the time of the purity of the Latin tongue, when the word <hi>Serenus</hi> was never uſed in the Title of any Prince or Perſon, I ſhall go on to deale with the utmoſt candor foraſmuch as in this Nation the nicety of that moſt eloquent language is not ſo perfectly underſtood, which gives occaſion to theſe
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98085:117"/>
miſtakes.<note n="*" place="bottom">And indeed there being no literature amongſt them, they have no occaſion to learne the Original Languages, ſo that few of them do underſtand <hi>Latin.</hi> True it is that in the Court ſome have the curioſity to learn it, as this <hi>Golozof</hi> who is ſpoken of before. Which gave my Lord occaſion to write ſometimes in <hi>Latin.</hi>
                  </note> I confeſs therefore that indeed in the declination of the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, and when there ſcarce could be found out words enough to ſupply the modern ambition of Titles, <hi>Sereniſſimus</hi> as ſeveral other words hath grown in faſhion for a compellation of leſſer as well as greater Princes, and yet befits both the one and the other. So there is <hi>Sereniſſima Reſpublica Veneta, Serenitates Electoriae, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renitates Regiae,</hi> even as the word <hi>Highneſs</hi> or <hi>Celſitudo</hi> befits a Duke a Prince a King or an Emperour, adjoyning to it the reſpective quality, and ſo the word <hi>Illuſtris.</hi> But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it were by modern uſe (which I deny) depreſſed from the undoubted ſuperiority that it had of <hi>Serenus</hi> in the pureſt antiquity, yet being added in the tranſcendent degree to the word Emperour, the higheſt denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a Prince is capable of, it becomes of the ſame value. So that to interpret <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſſimus</hi> unto diminution is to find a poſitive in a ſuperlative, and in the moſt orient light to ſeek for darkneſs. And I would, ſeeing the near <hi>Boyars</hi> and Counſellors of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty are pleaſed to mention the Title given to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty by his Ceſarian Majeſty

For the King my Maſter who poſſeſſes as conſiderable Dominions, and by as high and ſelf-dependent a right as any Prince in the Univerſe, yet contenting Himſelf with the eaſieſt Titles, and ſatiſfying Himſelf in the eſſence of things, doth moſt willingly give to other Princes the Titles which are appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to them, but to the <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> his Royal Anceſtors, and to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty his Royal Majeſty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, have uſually and do gladly pay Titles even to ſuperfluity out of meer kindneſs.

And I dare promiſe You that his Majeſty will upon the firſt information from me ſtile him <hi>Sereniſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and I (notwithſtanding what I have ſaid) ſhall make little difficulty of altering the word in that ſpeech, and of delivering it ſo to You, with that proteſtation that I have not in uſing that word <hi>Illuſtriſſimus</hi> erred nor uſed any diminution (which God forbid) to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, but on the contrary after the example of the King my Maſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and ſhewed him all poſſible honor. And ſo God grant all happineſs to His moſt high, moſt Potent, moſt Illuſtrious, and moſt Serene <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, and that the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may daily increaſe betwixt His ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and his moſt Serene Majeſty my Maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such was concerning this matter my Lord Ambaſſadors anſwer, who thought fit alſo on his ſide to give them notice (ſeeing they were ſo ſcrupulous about the</hi> Tzar's <hi>Titles) to uſe for the Kings Majeſty the Title of Defender of the Faith, which hitherto they had alwaies omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:98085:119"/>
The King my Maſter, ſaith he, hath one eſſential Title, and which He prizes more than thoſe of all his dominions, <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> an immemorial, indubitable, ſucceſſive Title from his Anceſtors, and as alwaies heretofore, ſo in His laſt Letter to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty He uſeth it; in this Court ever ſince my coming I think by ſome inadvertency omitted. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that in ſtyling his Majeſty my Maſter, and in all Letters to Him henceforward, it may be inſerted according as belongs to Him.</p>
               <p>The nineteenth of <hi>March Pronchiſſof</hi> brought to my Lord an anſwer to his given the 29. of <hi>February,</hi> whereby the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners complain much in the firſt place that he writ with ſlighting the honourable orders of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties forces, and with little repute for his Poſts. Therefore they do not like at all this expreſſion of my Lords, where he ſaies, <hi>that the nearer one comes to</hi> Moſco, <hi>men are more ignorant of the Roads;</hi> ſo that they freely ſay, it was not handſom for him to ſpeak ſo. Moreover they deny the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Friendſhip between the two Crowns to be (as my Lord ſaid) the Grant of the Priviledges, but only the mutual Love of both Princes. That therefore the Priviledges were taken away by reaſon of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebellion to his late Majeſty, and that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty being in miſery, his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty comforted. Him with Letters, and (as
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98085:119"/>
they are pleaſed to ſay) furniſhed him with Bread and Money. Whereas His Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty doth not offer to give their great Lord any aſſiſtance againſt his preſent Enemies, the <hi>Pole</hi> and the <hi>Crim Tartar,</hi> as had done former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Royal Father to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties Father, againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland.</hi> But beſides the wars (wherein the <hi>Tzar</hi> was then engaged) and the King's cold aſſiſtance, they blame alſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> merchants who had lately refuſed the <hi>Tzars</hi> Ambaſſadors in <hi>England</hi> to lend him money for the war. Yet notwithſtanding it ſeemes the <hi>Tzar</hi> will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ten <hi>Engliſh</hi> merchants, new men, ſuch as His Royal Majeſty ſhall think fit to make choice of, that ſhould faithfully obſerve ſuch lawful conditions as ſhould be required of them, to drive a free trade, after ſuch a time that his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties Warrs ceaſe with <hi>John Caſſimir</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> and the <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Crim.</hi> Laſtly they finde the anſwer about the Titles to be mighty full of offences, and that his Excellency doth much diminiſh their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect when he ſaies, that they are not fitly grounded; Whereas being at Conference with them, he called them (as they ſay) His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties potent <hi>Boyars,</hi> wiſe, and rightly honourable. And that therefore that man is not fit to lay the foundation of things, who praiſes in his words, and in his writings diſpraiſes without the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:98085:120"/>But as to the firſt Complaint, his Excellency by an anſwer given in Conference the 22. of <hi>March</hi> replies, that (as it is eaſie to be ſeen) his words are miſunderſtood, and what ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the honour of all perſons that deſerve it, is by His Commiſſioners perverted to the ſlighting of them. And whereas they ſay, it was not handſom for him to ſay, that the nearer one comes to <hi>Moſco,</hi> men are more ignorant of the Roads; he anſwers, that it ſeemes they rather undertake to cenſure him as Judges on the bench, than treat with him as Counſellors of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty.

As for the Reproach (which my Lord took very ill) of his <hi>Tzars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy</hi> Majeſties aſſiſtance to the King, whom their moſt Wiſe Prince, as they call him, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with bread; his Excellency ſaid, he agreed in that with them, foraſmuch as the Wiſeſt of Princes ſaith, <hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters, and after many daies thou ſhalt finde it again,</hi> as alſo it hath happened; And again he ſaid, that only our bleſſed Saviour could multiply the five loaves. That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98085:120"/>
hath and will own perpetually that courteſy, that he hath in his name declared it, and given his thanks in the face of the whole World. But this he would minde his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties <hi>Boyars</hi> and Counſellors, that even papers of Obligation are ſullied and worn out with too much handling; and ſo is it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Obligations themſelves, when men too often repeat their own good actions. Concerning the matter of Trade his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency tells them, that with all becoming thanks for the good intention of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, he refuſes to treat of any ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as were in their laſt propoſal, having no Commiſſion or Latitude from the King to go leſs in matter of Trade, than the Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the former Priviledges.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland;</hi> his Excellency tells them, whether ſeeing in this and many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions they ſeem to weigh the generous actions of Princes by <hi>Salotnicks</hi> (or ounces) they would think it civil in him, ſhould he ſay, that his Royal Majeſties Father of highly glorious memory lent his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98085:121"/>
Father of highly glorious memory, beſides thoſe men of <hi>Sanderſons,</hi> forty thouſand Rix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dollers and they were repaid, even as His preſent <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty lent his preſent Royal Majeſty the ſame ſum, and they are repaid. And that moreover upon his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties Commiſſion to Sir <hi>John Hebdon,</hi> his preſent Majeſtie granted the levying of three thouſand horſe and foot for his preſent <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, which might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as good as either Bread or Treaſury, and if it were not effected, it was not his Royal Majeſties fault: So that hitherto the obligations are equal. As to thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences contained (as the Commiſſioners pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) in the latter part of his Excellencies anſwer, it ſeemes they fix them all in his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That they are not well or fitly grounded.

               <p>In this Conference my Lord Ambaſſador did alſo intreat his Commiſſioners, that he might have a private Audience of his <hi>Tzars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy</hi> Majeſty, thinking to finde more favour from the <hi>Tzar,</hi> as concerning his moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affaires, if he could himſelf inſtill into his Majeſties ears his ſtrong and ſolid reaſons, with the evaſions and friendleſs dealing of the Lords Commiſſioners. But, as if they had firſt reſolved to grant nothing at all, it was hard enough to my Lord Ambaſſador to obtain this Audience; And when at laſt they told him of the day, appointed for that purpoſe by his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, they ſaid it was not for any buſineſs ſake, but to compleat their great Lords brotherly love and friendſhip with his Royal Majeſty, as if that could be done meerly by ſeeing the <hi>Tzar</hi> private. My Lord Ambaſſador finding this anſwer as much unfit for his buſineſs as it is ridiculous, made them to underſtand, how Princes in former Age and moſt in this had, and have by ſuch imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Intercourſe, occaſion fuller to inform themſelves of all matters, and to remove a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then indeed he ſpoke at length with all the advantage he could deſire himſelf, and added to the ſtrength of reaſoning the eloquence of the language. He refuted, as much to the purpoſe as could be, all his Commiſſioners Objections before alledged, whereupon they purpoſed to ground the <hi>Refuſal of the Priviledges,</hi> he repreſented to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty how little of ſolidity there is, that they are but weak pretences, and that his Royal Majeſty muſt needs be much ſenſible of this proceeding ſo contrary to his expectations. But, to give more weight to the matter, he ſpeaks in the Kings own perſon, after he hath made a Preface from himſelf. Of this ſame Speech there were two Copies given to the Commiſſioners, one in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the other in <hi>Latin</hi> as followeth.</p>

                           <head>May it pleaſe Your moſt Potent and moſt Serene <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty.</head>
                           <p>HAving continued here ten weeks ſince your Tzarskoy majeſty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me your near Boyars and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors Commiſſioners, and finding my ſelf ſtill further of every day from any good ſucceſs of my Negotiation, I have been forced, as thoſe who cannot get over the violence or winding of the river, to make up to the fountain. Your Tzarskoy majeſty is through your ſo great Dominions the only Fountain of Power and Reaſon, and as all your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ought to humble themſelves to your power, ſo dare I ſubject my ſelf to your Reaſon. Foraſmuch as it ſeemes to me that God has given, as to <hi>Solomon,</hi> not only riches and honor to your Tzarskoy majeſty, but alſo an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding heart; So that as there was none among your Tzarskoy Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:98085:133"/>
before, ſo neither can any ariſe after like unto you. Therefore have I deſired and obtained this private Audience from your Tzarskoy majeſty. And even ſo did that firſt and great founder of the Amity betwixt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Crowns, &amp; of the Privileges to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, <hi>Tzar Ivan Baſilovich.</hi> So did He uſe to diſcourſe and converſe in private with the Ambaſſadors of the Kings and Queens of <hi>England,</hi> and by that means, notwithſtanding the ill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of ſome of his Counſel and the then Lord Chancelour, he took ſuch true meaſures of his own affaires, that ever ſince the mutual friendſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce hath continued and flouriſhed betwixt the two Crowns and Nations till your Tzarskoy majeſty now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Neither do I doubt but that I, being come for the ſaid purpoſe with as ſincere intentions betwixt Princes mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually profeſſing much greater affection, ſhall by Gods bleſſing go away hence
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:98085:134"/>
from the cleare eyes of your Tzarskoy majeſty with as full ſatisfaction.</p>
                           <p>For whereas all other great Princes without any notice from his Royal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty took care to follow him into his Kingdoms with Extraordinary Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Congratulation, the King my Maſter out of his ſingular kindneſs and affection did to your Tzarskoy majeſty alone, of all the Princes in Chriſtendom write firſt the tenth of <hi>May</hi> 1661. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore You had ſent your Ambaſſadors to inform You of His happy Reſtauration &amp; acknowlege your Tzarskoy majeſties brotherly kindneſs ſhewed to Him in His affliction. And further in the ſame letter ſignified that, though Sir <hi>John Hebdon</hi> had not preſented any Letters of Credence to his Royal majeſty from your Tzarskoy majeſty, yet in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truſt your Tzarskoy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty repoſed in him, his Royal majeſty had upon his deſire for your ſervice granted the levy of three thouſand
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:98085:134"/>
horſe and foot under Officers of great courage, ability and fidelity. Adding moreover that your Enemies ſhould know by the inſtance of his Royal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Miniſters, that they ſhould do a thing very grateful to him in making a good and laſting peace with your Tzars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy majeſty, and if by Their default ſuch peace were not imbraced, that they and all the World ſhould ſee the great affection He hath for the proſperity of your affaires, which ſhould be alwayes in his particular care. Alſo in the ſame Letter his Royal majeſty acknowleges your Tzarskoy majeſties magnanimity in withdrawing your Protection from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants during the late Rebellion, and deſires that all his Royal majeſties good Subjects being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their Allegeance, your Tzars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy majeſty would reſtore them their houſes eſtates and privileges, and that You declare the ſame; Upon which your Tzarskoy majeſties declaration he
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:98085:135"/>
would ſend forthwith his Ambaſſador to expreſſe further His ſenſe of your Tzarskoy majeſties affection, and to make all poſſible returns of the ſame. Hereupon your Tzarskoy majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned anſwer of the 28. <hi>July</hi> 1661. That your Tzarskoy majeſty deſired to continue with his Royal majeſty the ſame friendſhip and correſpondency, which had been betwixt both your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of bleſſed memory, and that as to what his Royal majeſty ſaid, he would ſend his Ambaſſador about, your Tzars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy majeſty would be ready, ſo farr as is poſſible, to give aſſent thereto. After this your Tzarskoy majeſty in your Letter of the 31. <hi>July</hi> 1662. ſent by your late Extraordinary Ambaſſadors writ alſo, that taking into your prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſideration the flouriſhing Eſtate of your Tzarsva, and that intire bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love and amity and frequent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency, which inviolably was held and continued betwixt both your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

Upon theſe aſſurances on your Tzarskoy majeſties part, his Royal majeſty diſpatched me hither, where what I ſaid in the face of the whole World by his Royal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Command in his name, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the mutual and equal affection of his Royal majeſty, is perfectly known to Your Tzarskoy majeſtie. Your Tzars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy was then pleaſed to appoint me Commiſſioners, perſons of great no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility

But when as I at my firſt Conference according to his Royal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties order moved firſt for the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Privileges, ſignifying in the ſame writing that theſe being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted I had other things to profer on his Royal majeſties part out of his affection to your Tzarskoy majeſty, I received from my Commiſſioners ſo unexpected an anſwer, that had heaven faln as the windowes of the Counſel-chamber broke in twice at the recital, it could ſcarce have been more ſtrange or mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to me. It amounted in effect to an abſolute denyal of the Privileges Firſt indeed they ſay that they wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Rebellion. But after that they affirm that his late Royal majeſty of ever bleſſed memorie by <hi>Luke Nightingale</hi> deſired that the Privileges might be nulled, then they allege ſeveral miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, after that a petition of the <hi>Goſes</hi> and all the Traders in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> then that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants are dead. In a ſecond paper they ſpeak of Your warrs with the <hi>Crim</hi> and the <hi>Pole,</hi> that his Royal majeſty furniſhed not your Tzarskoy majeſty with mony, that the Merchants of the <hi>Moſcovia</hi> Companie refuſed to lend mony towards your Tzarskoy majeſties warrs being deſired by your Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors. And ſeveral other reaſons to make up the number though any one of them would have ſerved, if it be indeed reſolved before hand not to grant the Privileges, but altogether will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound one ſolid argument, if weighed by ſo piercing and deep a judgement as that of Your majeſty. So that my

Commiſſioners, wholly cutting off all hopes of the Privileges for the preſent inſiſted only that I ſhould declare to them what elſe I had to offer from his Royal majeſty. And I profering to them, that if they had any thing as that remained on their part, and was proper for them to propound for your Tzars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy majeſties ſervice, I ſhould give them a fitting anſwer. And only deſiring to be reſolved by them, whether in caſe my propoſals ſhould ſeem to them equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the Privileges they had then power to grant them, they could not or did not give me any ſatiſfaction therein. I appeale to your Tzarskoy majeſty, whether I having a plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Letter from his Royal majeſty to your Tzarskoy majeſty (which is in it ſelf ſufficient) and over and above that a particular Commiſſion under the great ſeale of <hi>England</hi> for the Recovery of the privileges, it were fit for m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Had I deſired any new thing of your Tzarskoy majeſty my dear and loving Brother, or to which your Tzarskoy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had not formerly ingaged Your ſelf, I might with leſs unkindneſs have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Your ſo long deliberation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have digeſted the refuſal. But as for the Privileges they have continued above an hundred years, and have by that their duration approved the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of that reaſon of State, upon which they were firſt founded, and it has been always dangerous by new experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſhake the foundation of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient counſels and friendſhips. And as for your Tzarskoy majeſties ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (to omit your Tzarskoy majeſties declaration in the year 1645. at Your firſt coming to the Crown by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Archangel</hi> to the Merchants at <hi>Archangel,</hi> that your Tzarskoy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty confirmed to them all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98085:138"/>
granted by your Tzarskoy maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Father of bleſſed memory, and that You would be as gracious to them as ever Your ſaid Father or any of Your Predeceſſors) did not your Tzarskoy majeſty in Your firſt letter upon my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Reſtitution of the Privileges anſwer me, that your Tzarskoy majeſty deſired to continue with me in the ſame friendſhip and correſpondency that had been betwixt both our Fathers of bleſſed memory, and that upon my Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors arrival and propoſition You would be ready as farr as is poſſible to give aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereto? Did not your Tzarskoy majeſties Ambaſſadors, being demanded by my ſelf concerning the Privileges, reply as their own opinion, that they queſtioned not but your Tzarskoy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty upon my deſire by an honourable Embaſſy, would for the love You had to me doubtleſs grant them? Did not your Tzarskoy majeſty in Your Letter by them of the 31. of <hi>July</hi> 1662. writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98085:139"/>
from Your privy Chamber under your Tzarskoy majeſties own hand uſe thoſe golden words which could indeed drop from no other pen or ſenſe than that of your Tzarskoy majeſty, and which are therefore ingraven in my heart as with the point of a diamond, and which being alſo ſo conſonant to mine own intire affection to your Tzars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy majeſty, I commanded my Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador to return in the very ſame terms in my name to your Tzarskoy majeſty, that your Tzarskoy majeſtie taking in to conſideration the flouriſhing eſtate of your Tzarsva, &amp;c.<note place="bottom">So the whole Letter was here repeated again as afore, foraſmuch as it carries with it ſo ſtrong a conviction as can receive no excuſe: and indeed it ſeemes the Commiſſioners found it to be ſo, ſeeing they never ſaid one word as to thoſe Letters.</note> Surely the ſame correſpondency and friendſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the ſame treaties and agreements, and therefore ſo You obliged Your ſelf for the Privileges, unleſs (becauſe your Tzarskoy majeſty indeed limits
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:98085:139"/>
Your ſelf with that word afterwards) it be not poſſible to grant them. But that cannot be, your Tzarskoy majeſty being ſo great a Prince, and having all power, and therefore ſo properly ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>ſelf-upholder.</hi> If, <hi>as farr as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> ſignify a denyal I ſhall know how to underſtand it for the future. And as to thoſe words in your Tzarskoy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſecond Letter to me of the 31. of <hi>July</hi> 1662. how can there be a nearer and firmer correſpondency betwixt Us, unleſs firſt it be as near and as firm as formerly? But ſuppoſe any perſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to Our mutual friendſhip could pick out ſome evaſions in Your manner of expreſſion, to ſeem to diſingage You, yet let me tell You dear Brother ſuch ſubtilties might perhaps be neceſſary or ſerve the turn with confining Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with whom You are alwayes either at open warr or ſuſpicious friendſhip. But it would be much below You and Me, Friends of an hundred years, free
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:98085:140"/>
from all reaſon of jealouſy of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to leave ſuch loop-holes in Our ſouls, and to penetrate and ſqueeze Our ſelves through our own words. Neither let it ſeem ſtrange to You, or as an undervaluing of the mutual princely Amity betwixt Us, that I ſeem to place it upon the reſtoring or not reſtoring of the Privileges, and have therefore commanded my Ambaſſador before any further overture of my good intentions toward your Tzarskoy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to deſire the Grant of thoſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges which belong but to my Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. For they were ſo from the firſt a voluntary grant, and I do not love to go leſs as (God be praiſed) I need not than any of my Predeceſſors. And thoſe Privileges are but the Princely conſtant reward of that perpetual and vaſt advantage, which hath and may alwayes continue to the <hi>Tzars</hi> of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and their whole <hi>Tzarsva</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants firſt diſcovery and opening
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98085:140"/>
of the Trade at Archangel, with the loſs of many mens lives, ſhipping and eſtates; though great Princes even for an action once well done, and whereof the fruit dyes with that time and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are uſed to recompenſe to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity. But my chief motive for ſuch a preliminary deſire was indeed your Tzarskoy majeſties honour, of which I ſhall always be moſt tender, that as your Tzarskoy majeſtie took away the Privileges out of Your high generoſity and reſentment of the late Rebellion, ſo it might appeare to the whole world by Your reinſtating the <hi>Engliſh</hi> therein, without any farther reach of reaſon, only upon their return to their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and my deſire, how juſt and perfect You were in the proportioning of Your actions, and how like that great Prince you are, you know to place Your Obligations upon me. For that is amity to me which is the advantage of my Subjects, and if even in my Exile
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:98085:141"/>
I could not but partake ſome joy in their wellfare, certainly upon my happy return I ſhall by all means ſtrive to procure and advance it. To what purpoſe are ſo many Treaties in the World betwixt Princes, but all for the conſtituting the conveniencies and profit of their Subjects? Treaties of Peace, of Trade, of Aſſiſtance, nay even of Marriage of the Princes are they, becauſe thoſe Princes fall in love with one another; or are not all directed to the ſecurity and proſperity of the people? But leſt therefore as I demand them for the benefit of mine, ſo You ſhould refuſe them for the benefit of your people, let us (if your Tzarskoy majeſty pleaſe) try the arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them of ſeveral natures as they ly before me.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>They rebelled againſt me:</hi> 'Tis true, but it would be too much care in your Tzarskoy majeſty, ſhould You purſue the reſentment for ever upon my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98085:141"/>
after I my ſelf have forgiven them; And I being the Head, and making up hence forward but one Body with my Nations, will your Tzarskoy majeſty undertake to revenge upon me the diſloyalty of my people? <hi>But they ſay that</hi> Nightingale <hi>brought a Letter from my Father, and treated with the</hi> Boyars <hi>for taking them away.</hi> That <hi>Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi> was a Traytor therein and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, and I know your Tzarskoy majeſty will according to the law of Nations, and as Princes are obliged in honour to one another upon ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures deliver me that open falſe counterfeit letter. But if my Father had at that time for reaſon of State de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the taking of them away, whereas to the contrary, He bleſſed Prince even to His laſt breath prayed and laboured for the good of His ſubjects, and even as to this matter had prepared a Letter which I yet preſerve among His other Reliques, wherein He deſires of your
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98085:142"/>
Tzarskoy majeſty the Reſtitution of the privileges, and diſavowes <hi>Nightingale</hi> as an Impoſtor, but had He I ſay then deſired they might be revoked, I alſo do now deſire they may be reſtored. <hi>The Merchants are complained of for ſeveral miſcarriages contrary to the condition of the Privileges.</hi> None of thoſe miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages are verifyed, but however I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my Ambaſſador to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the poſſibility of any ſuch thing for the future, and I my ſelf ſhould alſo have been a ſevere Inſpector of any ſuch default, as intrenching highly upon mine own honour. <hi>But the Goſes and all the Tradeſmen of</hi> Ruſſia <hi>petitioned, that the</hi> Engliſh <hi>were become rich by theſe Privileges, and Your Majeſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were impoveriſhed.</hi> How is it then that your Tzarskoy majeſty ſaid in your Letter above mentioned, that much happineſs peace and tranquillity had accrued to both Dominions? why do they not alſo againſt the Privilege,

                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:98085:148"/>This ſpeech being thus ended, my Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador added four Memorials, which he gave alſo in writing, but in a paper by it ſelf. Three of them were againſt <hi>Pronchiſſof,</hi> who endeavoured by all meanes to obſtruct my Lords affaires, and to make him odious to this Court. It ſeemes he had told my Lord that his Royal Majeſties affaires were in a dangerous and weak condition, ſo that my Lord being confident that he had ſtrove to inſtil this falſe report into the <hi>Tzars</hi> ear, thought himſelfe bound upon this occaſion to inform his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, that what he ſaid therein was contrary to the truth, and maliciously invented by Enemies of his Royal Majeſty, and that the King was in as good condition of quiet at home and power abroad as any Prince in Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>Another time the ſame <hi>Pronchiſſof</hi> told my Lord Ambaſſador at his houſe in the preſence of <hi>Dementè Baſhmacof</hi> and of a Colonel <hi>van Staden</hi> their Interpreter, that it was reported his Excellency had received a great ſumme of mony of the Merchants to recover the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and upon the effecting thereof was to receive yet greater from the ſaid Merchants; whereupon my Lord requiring his author he would or could name none; ſo that his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency took him for the Author himſelf, as it was very likely. Therefore upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he acquainted the <hi>Tzar</hi> with it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:98085:148"/>
his Majeſty to cauſe Reparation to be given him by the ſaid <hi>Pronchiſſof</hi> for ſo mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and high a ſlander.</p>
               <p>Beſides the ſaid <hi>Pronchiſſof</hi> at ſeveral other times ſpoke to my Lord Ambaſſador, as if he had neglected his Royal Majeſties buſineſs in reſpect to the Merchants, and threatned him with the <hi>Tzars</hi> diſpleaſure, that he ſhould not depart with honour, and as if his <hi>Tzars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy</hi> Majeſty would complain of his conduct to his Royal Majeſty, whoſe inſtructions he ſaid that my Lord had tranſgreſſed. In all which things he much diminiſhed the reſpect due to his Excellency, and doubtleſs exceeded any Commiſſion from his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty: My Lord did not neglect to informe his Majeſty of all theſe things upon this preſent occaſion, and to tell Him, that for theſe and for the former reaſons he takes the ſaid <hi>Pronchiſſof</hi> (who was at this Audience) to be an Enemy to the good correſpondence betwixt his Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no Friend to himſelf. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever he might have reported at any time, or would afterwards concerning him, to give his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty (as he had all reaſon to ſuſpect) an ill taſte and impreſſion of him: He deſires his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty to hold it for falſhood, as he himſelf was ready to prove it if his Majeſty had thought fit at any
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:98085:149"/>
time to communicate any ſuch thing to him for his own ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>He put moreover his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty in minde of the former Reparation promiſed, which ſtill his Commiſſioners had neglected hitherto.</p>
               <p>The 24. of <hi>May,</hi> my Lord received his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners anſwer to his papers given at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference the 22. of <hi>March,</hi> wherein firſt they blame his Excellency for ſaying in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that they miſunderſtood his words, as if he had a mind thereby to tell them, that they were not able to underſtand his meaning. But for the Poſts innocent miſtake (as they call it) they ſay that ſatisfaction is given hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They do not like at all this expreſſion of my Lords, where he ſaies that they ſeeme to weigh the generous actions of Princes by <hi>Salotnicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the ſeveral Demands contained in another paper, none but the ſecond demand had a ſatisfactory anſwer. The demand is this, that all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants deſiring to repair home might have their paſſes to go over ſea with their wives and families without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation. But it is fruſtrated by reaſon of the next following article, that juſtice might be done the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants for their debts, for of this there was no care at all taken. The next demand to that, which is of a great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and much againſt the cuſtome of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:98085:149"/>
that all his Royal Majeſties Subjects of what condition ſoever might upon their deſire have full liberty to return, is left without an anſwer. Now concerning ſome particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Kings, who looked for the <hi>Tzars</hi> favour or juſtice upon this occaſion by my Lord Ambaſſador they were all either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected or put off.</p>
               <p>The 27. of <hi>May,</hi> the Commiſſioners ſent to my Lord Ambaſſador their Anſwer to his Speech ſaid at the private Audience the 22. of <hi>April,</hi> but as to his Complaints againſt <hi>Pronchiſſof</hi> (who as in ſpight of his Excellency was ſtill in his <hi>Priſtafs</hi> office) there was not one word ſaid to that, nor to the other Memorial. And indeed they might as well have left the ſpeech unanſwered, ſeing their writings ſignify no more than their ſilence. For as heretofore ſo concerning this ſpeech, that perhaps might have had any where elſe a favourable anſwer, they ſay amongſt many words very litle or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the purpoſe. Their whole buſineſs it ſeemes is to catch at ſome expreſſions, which interpreting alwaies to their diſadvantage, they take thereby occaſion to give his <hi>Tzars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy</hi> Majeſty an ill taſt of his Excellency, and ſo to obſtruct his buſineſs. To that purpoſe they alledge firſt, that in a place of his ſpeech he calles them perſons of great wiſdom and experience (whereas there is, of great nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and experience) and that in another place
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:98085:150"/>
he writes as if they could not ſhew in all their anſwers one certain or ſolid reaſon for the denyal of the propounded Privileges. They do extreamly wonder at ſuch an expreſſion, and that being a man of great underſtanding he would ſometimes praiſe them (which they take in very good part) and ſometimes vilify them. But whereas my Lord ſaies in another place of his Speech, That he received from his Commiſſioners ſo unexpected an anſwer, that had Heaven fallen, as the windows of the Councel-Chamber broke in twice at the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, it could ſcarce have been more ſtrange or miraculous to him, they are pleaſed to ſay, that it was not fitting for him to ſpeak ſo to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty. But here is the grand ſcandalous and unhandſome expreſſion (as they take it) that ſtickt to the <hi>Tzars</hi> very heart, when his Excellency, ſpeaking as from the Kings Majeſties own mouth concerning that unproportionable ſum of money that his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties Ambaſſadors demanded of his Royal Majeſty in <hi>England,</hi> ſaid, I hope ſo impoſſible a ſum to the greateſt Prince of Chriſtendom was not demanded on purpoſe to have a pretext to deny the Priviledges, and by propoſing an impoſſibility to refuſe what is rational. The Commiſſioners an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that this unhandſome expreſſion was an indignity, not only to the friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Princes, but chiefly to the perſon
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:98085:150"/>
of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, that ſuch a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was far from his Royal Majeſties mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that therefore their Great Lord would write about it to the King. As for the Priviledges they put them off till the wars be put to an end, and then the Merchants muſt ſtand upon the <hi>Tzars</hi> courteſie; Laſtly his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty doth indeed acknowledg the Kings affection to him, where it is ſpoken of thoſe fit opportunities, that his Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had and might have afterwards of aſſiſting Him upon all occaſions of War. The Commiſſioners ſaid, that their Great Lord received theſe Declarations of the Kings in brotherly, friendly amity and love. Therefore they deſired my Lord Ambaſſador to declare them, againſt which of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties Enemies his Royal Majeſty would aſſiſt their Great Lord, and whether with warlike men and ammunition, and if ſo, with how many warlike men and armes, and with what am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and whether his Royal Majeſty would give this Aſſiſtance out of his own Treaſury, and for what time, and to what place theſe his Majeſties men were to come. To that my Lord Ambaſſador gave them this anſwer, that in all theſe things he was not at all limited, but that they were left at his own beſt diſcretion, provided firſt, that his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty would ſhew a juſt value of his Royal Majeſties conſtant brotherly
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:98085:151"/>
love and friendſhip. But what concernes the propounded Mediation betwixt the <hi>Tzar</hi> and his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> it was anſwered by the Commiſſioners, that there was an Everlaſting Peace concluded between Them, and that thoſe things that fell out after the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, might be quieted by Meſſages on both ſides.</p>
               <p>As to the Additional Memorials preſented to the <hi>Tzars</hi> Majeſty againſt <hi>Pronchiſſof,</hi> my Lord had at laſt an anſwer after a long ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but it was too much like their Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration about the miſcarriage of our Entrance at <hi>Moſco.</hi> They ſaid, that my Lord ought not to complain againſt him, that whatſoever he was told by him in familiar diſcourſes it was not out of malignity, but after a friendly way, ſo that his Excellency might take care of himſelf and of his affaires. As to the Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration promiſed upon his Entrance at <hi>Moſco,</hi> they do not ſo much as ſpeak one word of it.</p>
               <p>And now to put an end to a Negotiation, where ſo much is ſaid and ſo little effected, I ſhall add another important buſineſs that paſſed betwixt his Excellency and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners. My Lord having newly received power and authority from the King to offer his Mediation betwixt the <hi>Tzars</hi> Majeſty and the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> thought, that ſo kind an offer might perhaps bring his buſineſs to a
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:98085:151"/>
better end, than he had done hitherto. He acquainted his Commiſſioners with it, and offered himſelf to do his uttermoſt in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that affair, in what manner his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty ſhould direct for his Service, Provided that He would firſt manifeſt a juſt value of his Royal Majeſties moſt ſincere and conſtant brotherly affection, by the grant of his former demands. The offer did pleaſe them very well, becauſe it came in very good time, but the condition annexed was too hard, ſeeing they had doubtleſs reſolved not to grant the Priviledges. Yet they deſired my Lord Ambaſſador to give this matter in writing at a Conference, which they agreed upon to be had the firſt of <hi>June:</hi> and the mean while the <hi>Tzar</hi> appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe new Commiſſioners to treat of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that newly was come in hand. [So that at laſt his Excellency was rid from <hi>Pronchiſſof,</hi> whom the <hi>Tzar</hi> had ſtill employed a great while when He ſent any meſſage to my Lord Ambaſſador, notwithſtanding the ſolemn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration made againſt him at the private Audience: and in his ſtead there was another ſupplied for a <hi>Priſtaf,</hi> who was indeed a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viller man, but of leſſer quality.] The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition given by my Lord in writing at this Conference was written after this manner.</p>

               <p>The Commiſſioners Anſwer to this matter was, that his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty was well pleaſed with this profer of his Royal Majeſty, that his Excellency in proſecution thereof ſhould ſend a Poſt to his Majeſty of <hi>Poland</hi> by way of <hi>Smolenſco,</hi> and proceed himſelf in the

buſineſs as might be meet and fitting. But it ſeemes they did not or would not mind what his Excellency had required, before he would ingage his Prince in ſo long and chargeable a deſigne. Therefore he made them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that otherwiſe he could not undertake it, becauſe his Royal Majeſty took it for granted, that he had before this effected his buſineſs, which was the reaſon of this His laſt generous profer.

He pretended to be much troubled that the State of his affaires would not permit him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his deſires, and prayed God for the proſperity of his Voiage.

               <p>This being the Negociation and ſucceſs of the Embaſſie, let us now take a proſpect of the moſt memorable paſſages that hapned during our reſidence at <hi>Moſco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt thing that preſents it ſelf is the deſcription of a Feaſt which the <hi>Tzar</hi> made to my Lord Ambaſſador the 19. of <hi>February</hi> in the hall wherein his Excellence had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; it was a meale of near nine houres long, from two in the afternoon till eleven at night. My Lord Ambaſſador was conducted thither very ſolemnly, but being entred into the hall, the <hi>Tzar</hi> who was ſitting upon his Throne forgot not to retain his ordinary gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and though he had not then his Crown upon his head, he thought it too great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention for a perſon of his grandeur to vaile his bonnet to the Ambaſſador. From
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:98085:154"/>
whence it may be eaſiely conjectured that his Excellence was not admitted to his table, and indeed it was ſo farr from that, that he was plac't at another on his left hand, ſome ſteps lower than his own, whilſt his principal <hi>Boyars</hi> had not only their table on his right hand, but at a leſs diſtance from his Throne. In ſo much as in that place where my Lord Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador ought to have received all honor and civility, there it was that they ſtudied as it were to treat him diſobligingly. He was ſeated alone on one ſide next the wall, and on the other there was one of the <hi>Tzars</hi> Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors and a <hi>Stolnick</hi> to bear him Company. In a direct line and near his table they plac't my Lord <hi>Morpeth,</hi> and with him (by expreſs or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the <hi>Tzar</hi>) not only the Gentlemen and Pages but the Footmen alſo, it being his pleaſure to regale us altogether.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:98085:155"/>
of us imployed our ſelves in obſerving the great ſtone Pillar mentioned before, which they had adorned for a Show with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful quantity of Gold and Silver Veſſels, amongſt which there were many curious pieces: In this manner we ſate almoſt half an hour, before our meat was brought up. At laſt the <hi>Stolnicks</hi> entred, with their great bonnets upon their heads, and brought the firſt meat to the <hi>Tzars</hi> Table, preſently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they ſerved the <hi>Boyars,</hi> and then my Lord Ambaſſador and his Train. Our firſt diſh was Caviare, which we eat as a Sallad, after which we had a ſort of Pottage that was very ſweet, as alſo ſeveral ſorts of fiſh baked, fried, and boyled; but no fleſh, becauſe it was Lent. Yet that hindered not but that we had near five hundred diſhes, which were very handſomely dreſſed, had not the diſhes been ſo very black, that they looked more like Lead than Silver. Of all theſe diſhes they made as it were but one courſe, new coming in continually; but as we had no napkins al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us, ſo wanted we but little of having no plates alſo. All we could obtain for ſo many diſhes was but every one his own, and my Lord Ambaſſador in that reſpect had no advantage of his Servants. Beſides theſe we were well provided with very good <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine, white and red Mead; Quaz, and ſtrong Waters, which they had tempered with ſweet
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:98085:155"/>
and odoriferous ingredients. We were not much troubled nor importuned to drink to Exceſs, only they would often advertiſe us not to forget their great Dukes health. Thoſe that attended us were all Gentlemen of quality, which perhaps was the reaſon we were not ſo well ſerved as we could have wiſhed. When meat was brought in, there were twelve of the Guards du Corps ordered to enter, who put themſelves in order with their Halbards by the Hall door right over againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. After them entered two Lords with the Swords Royal, who approaching the Throne, with a profound Reverence, placed themſelves of each ſide of the <hi>Tzar,</hi> with their ſwords naked upon their ſhoulders. Night drawing on, they furniſhed their Scon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with Wax-candles, and a while after the <hi>Tzar</hi> ſignified his deſire to diſcourſe for ſome time with the Ambaſſador. Whereupon his Excellence roſe from the Table, and being come near the <hi>Tzar,</hi> he ſtood before him on the other ſide of the Table, ſo that they diſcourſed face to face. His Majeſty drank a Cup of Wine to the memory of the late King of <hi>England</hi> in theſe words, <hi>To the memory of that glorious Martyr</hi> Charles <hi>the firſt, who endured great afflictions here, and enjoyes now a greater meaſure of glory.</hi> After that he drank a health to our preſent King, and gave the Cup alwaies to the Ambaſſador with his
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:98085:156"/>
own hand. His Excellence alſo at his turn began a health to the two young Princes, and the <hi>Tzar</hi> ſeeming to neglect it, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor very gracefully intreated him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it. Some ſerious diſcourſe they had alſo about affaires of State, the <hi>Tzar</hi> ſpake to him about His Wars with the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and his Excellence on his ſide failed not to mention to him the ſubject of his Embaſſy, and to let him know he expected ſucceſs in it from himſelf only, and not from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners. By this time the <hi>deſart</hi> came in, and the <hi>Tzar</hi> invited the Ambaſſador to rake his place at the Table again. The firſt things they brought in, were little artificial trees with ſtore of branches candyed and guilt at the ends, on purpoſe for a ſhew; the reſt were nothing but a kind of fritters, wafers, and ſuch like trifles in paſte, made up after their faſhion. After we had been about half an hour longer at the Table, the Ambaſſador roſe again, and turning towards the <hi>Tzar</hi> they drank to one another ſeveral times, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador's Gentlemen having the honour to drink with his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, and receive their Wine from his own hands. But his Excellence obſerving with what eaſe the <hi>Tzar</hi> took off his Goblets, declared to him after a pleaſant manner, the juſt ſuſpicion he had of his liquour, which apparently could not be ſo ſtrong as that which was given to himſelf.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:98085:156"/>
The <hi>Tzar</hi> being in a good humour, gave him no anſwer, but laughed heartily at it. Yet a while after he found himſelf ſo warmed, that he fell a bleeding at the noſe as he was ſpeaking to the Ambaſſador; who departed thereupon, having firſt given his Majeſty thanks for his magnificent entertainment.</p>
               <p>The ſeventeenth of <hi>March</hi> we celebrated as the birth of the preſent <hi>Tzar,</hi> who was born on that day in the Year 1630. for which his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty ſent us a great dinner, and three or four <hi>Boyars</hi> to rejoyce with the Ambaſſador.</p>
               <p>The third of <hi>April</hi> being Palme-Sunday we had the ſight of a very noble Proceſſion, which is annually obſerved eight daies before Eaſter, in repreſentation of our Saviours En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The <hi>Tzar</hi> invited the Ambaſſador to ſee the Ceremonie; and (their Sledges being then out of date, by reaſon the Ice was for the moſt part diſſolved) ſent his Coach with a <hi>Stolnick,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaf</hi> to accompany him. The Ambaſſador being about to enter firſt into the Coach, the <hi>Stolnick</hi> had the preſumption to thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf forward and throw himſelf into it as it were headlong before him; and this with ſuch a diſorder, that it coſt him ſome trouble to recollect himſelf. His Excellence obſerving his temerity left him in ſole poſſeſſion of the Coach, and was returning up the ſtairs, when
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:98085:157"/>
the <hi>Stolnick</hi> came out again in great confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to aſſure him, that he had done nothing but by expreſs order, and according to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. The Ambaſſador replied, he knew very well, ſuch incivilities were not practiſed in other places, and that in <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Tzars</hi> Ambaſſadors had not been uſed in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The <hi>Stolnick</hi> underſtanding his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies reſolution not to go at all upon thoſe terms, diſpatched a Meſſenger immediately to the <hi>Tzar,</hi> to advertiſe him of what had paſt, and of the Ambaſſadors perſiſtence. The <hi>Tzar</hi> was then at his Devotion in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (as they call it) near the Caſtle-gate, and all things were ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Proceſſion; inſomuch as his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty to accelerate the Ambaſſadors arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val countermanded the orders of the <hi>Stolnick.</hi> Whereupon they departed immediately, and being come to the place that was reſerved for us, we found the <hi>Tzar</hi> already gone out of the Church, and marching on foot with his Crown on his head, in the midſt of a great number of <hi>Boyars</hi> and Churchmen; amongſt which there were two of his principal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of State, that led him by the armes. The Patriarch (a handſome man and of a good age) had a kind of a Diadem upon his head, and a great Croſs of Gold in his hand: The reſt of the Clergy were in their Surplices, and carrying Books, Banniers, Croſſes, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:98085:157"/>
Images upon long ſtaves before them, ſome of them ſinging, and ſome of them fuming the people with Incenſe. In this poſture they advanced along upon cloth to a certain Platform, where the Patriach preſented Palmes to the <hi>Tzar</hi> firſt, and then to the reſt. That done he took off the <hi>Tzars</hi> Cap, laid it upon a Silver plate, and preſented his golden croſs to him to kiſs. Which being with great reverence performed, the Patriarch waved it on high to both ſides; to them firſt that were in the Platform, who received that Benediction with great reverence likewiſe, and then to the People that were preſent, who at the ſame inſtant caſt themſelves along upon the ground, but more eſpecially the <hi>Tzars</hi> Guards who were amongſt them. After this they ſang certain hymns, which lengthned their Devotion a compleat hour. At this time there fell out a very pleaſant accident, occaſioned by the Lady Ambaſſadreſſes maid, mentioned at the beginning of this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; who deſirous to ſee the glory of this Proceſſion, had ſlipt herſelf amongſt my Lord Ambaſſadors Train, into the place appointed for us to ſee the Ceremonies. The place being higher than the reſt, and uncovered, the <hi>Tzar</hi> lifting up his eyes often towards us, at length took notice of this Maid, and obſerving her well dreſſed and near his Excellence (which was more than he had diſcerned) he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:98085:158"/>
imagined it was the Ambaſſadors Lady, and ſent immediately one of his <hi>Boyars</hi> to enquire of her health. The Ambaſſador al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſurpriſed with the Complement, returned his thanks to the <hi>Tzar</hi> for his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging intention, and withall gave him notice of the miſtake, whereupon the Maid was diſmiſt with a ſevere reprehenſion; and being amazed at the ſtrangeneſs of the adventure departed ſilently, confuſed betwixt the honor and ſhame ſhe had received at the ſame time. A while after for default of an aſs they brought the Patriarch to the entrance of the Platform a horſe diſguiſed like an aſs, with great artificial Ears, and (perhaps leſt they ſhould have diſcovered him to be a horſe by his Coat, or elſe have taken him for a red aſs) they covered him over with white Linnen. And then having covered his ſadle with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral very rich coverings, the Patriarch mounted by the help of a footſtool, and placed himſelf ſideling upon the horſe. After that, he bleſt the people with his Croſs as he went along, and the <hi>Tzar</hi> having reaſſumed his bonnet and Crown marched a foot before him leading his horſe by the bridle; as ſoon as they began their march there was a Chariot drawn by ſix horſes covered with white lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen alſo, that went before them, in which Chariot there was a tree garniſhed with a great number of apples, which they had faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98085:158"/>
to it, and on the Branches five or ſix men ſinging <hi>Hoſanna.</hi> The motion of this Tree was ſo ſtrange to thoſe who (not ſeeing the horſes that drew it) were ignorant of the cauſe, that ſome of them at firſt ſight lookt upon it as a Miracle.</p>
               <p>Eight days after this Proceſſion we had the Feaſt of Eaſter, in which the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> have a Cuſtome of preſenting one another with coloured Eggs. When they ſalute one they cry, <hi>Chriſtos wos chreſt,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>Chriſt is riſen,</hi> and the other anſwers, <hi>Woſtin wos chreſt,</hi> which is, <hi>He is riſen indeed.</hi> They do ordinarily kiſs one another in their Salutations, and he which ſalutes the other, preſents him with a coloured Egg. This Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony continues fifteen days, inſomuch as at that time there are many Shops, in which they ſell theſe Eggs ready dyed into a red or a Crimſon colour. The <hi>Tzar</hi> himſelf makes uſe of them to his Military Officers reſiding in <hi>Moſco,</hi> who coming all of them to kiſs his hand, his Majeſty gives each of them an Egg, accompanying his preſent with his Royal Benediction for the Succeſs of their Armes.</p>
               <p>On the nine and twentieth of <hi>May</hi> with great joy we ſolemnized both the birth of his Royal Majeſty, and his glorious Return to his Capital City. His Majeſty and the <hi>Tzar</hi> being born both in the Year 1630. there is
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:98085:159"/>
no great difference in their Age, only the <hi>Tzar</hi> was born the ſeventeenth of <hi>March,</hi> and is by conſequence ten weeks older. In this Feaſt his Excellence treated amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the principal of the three Ambaſſadors, whom the <hi>Tzar</hi> had a while before ſent to the King, and who departed from <hi>London</hi> but ſome few weeks before us. But that could not be done without the <hi>Tzars</hi> permiſſion, who according to their Politicks was much in trouble, ere he could reſolve to grant him this grace. And this, notwithſtanding the great amity they had contracted at <hi>London,</hi> was the only opportunity they had of ſeeing one another again. The <hi>Tzar</hi> for the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of their Mirth, ſent them a good quantity of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine and Mead.</p>
               <p>My Lord Ambaſſador entertained the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> Reſident (who was at that time in <hi>Moſco</hi>) very often alſo, by which means he had frequent conferences with him.</p>
               <p>About this time the Marriage was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated betwixt the good man that had hurt himſelf with his fall at <hi>Graveſend</hi> the next day after his departure from <hi>London,</hi> and the Maid I mentioned but lately. But the Bridegroom being as yet ſomething lame of his fall, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulcan</hi> was with being tumbled from heaven, it gave occaſion to one to ſay, and not unpleaſantly, that if he plaied <hi>

part, no doubt but ſhe could play that of <hi>Venus</hi> as well.</p>
               <p>I have before repreſented <hi>Moſco</hi> much Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to fire, and we had three inſtances of it during our reſidence there. The greateſt of all hapned on eaſter day, but devoured only ſome hundreds of houſes; and yet there was no more notice taken of it than of the two other. For to make a conflagration remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this Country, there muſt be at leaſt ſeven or eight thouſand houſes conſumed. But they have this advantage at <hi>Moſco,</hi> that they may buy houſes ready made, eſpecially in that part of the Town called <hi>Scoradom;</hi> which houſes they take to pieces, and having carryed them to the place where they deſigne their habitation, it requires no great time to put them together again. Beſides this they have other great markets where they ſell wood for building, and that in ſuch quantity one may have enough there to build a whole Town.</p>
               <p>In this place it was we had experience as well as at <hi>Vologda</hi> of the verity of that ſaying of <hi>Juvenal.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Which is that great houſes are commonly furniſht with haughty Servants. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt there had been great diſorder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ambaſſadors Gentlemen, had not
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:98085:160"/>
he prevented it by a reſolution which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared of not ſparing any one that ſought to make diviſion by unlawful ways. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there hapned one duell betwixt one of our family and a ſtranger that was a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in the Militia of the <hi>Tzar.</hi> The quarrel was, that being in company together, this laſt though a <hi>Scotchman</hi> ſeemed to extol the grandeur and glory of the <hi>Tzar</hi> to the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the King of <hi>England,</hi> which the other diſguſting magnifyed the King as much as was poſſible contrary to the judgment of his Antagoniſt, and challenged him thereupon into the field. And ſome few days after, this quarrel was diſputed by the ſword, and (had the preeminence of theſe Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon the ſucceſs of that combat) his Majeſty of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> had had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. For in a ſhort time our Champion diſarmed the Lieutenant, and came trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing amongſt us that he had vindicated his King.</p>
               <p>The ſixteenth of <hi>June,</hi> which was four days after my Lord had taken his Leave, the <hi>Tzar</hi> ſent the Ambaſſador a preſent of Sables, for himſelf and his whole family. His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies portion was worth two thouſand Crownes, that of the Counteſs was worth fourteen hundred, and my Lord <hi>Morpeth's</hi> a thouſand, the reſt were to be diſtributed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to every mans rank and imploiment
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:98085:160"/>
in the houſe. But the Ambaſſador conſidering he had been neglected in all his affaires, would by no meanes admit of this obligation; but from a generous principle returned the Preſent, as having been otherwiſe ſo much diſobliged. Nevertheleſs, that his refuſal might not paſs for an affront in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Tzar,</hi> my Lord deſigned to have prevented the ſending of it, but he had not time enough for that. For <hi>Golozof</hi> (of whom we had occaſion to ſpeak in the Deſcription of our Entry into <hi>Moſco</hi>) imagining without doubt he ſhould receive great kindneſſes from the Ambaſſador, diſpatched away one of his Clerks to advertiſe him, that he was coming to him with a Preſent from his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, wherewith he intended to honour him before his departure. And preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without acquainting any of the <hi>Priſtafs</hi> (in which he did ill) he arrived himſelf with four and thirty men bearing the Preſent in their hands. The Ambaſſador took <hi>Golozof</hi> aſide, and let him know, that he could not accept of this Honour for the reaſons which he alledged. <hi>Golozof</hi> extreamly amazed ran <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut immediately ſwelled up with rage, as he had been with vain hope of reward at his coming in; he leapt down the ſtairs by half douzains, as if he had been mad, and clapping his breaſt, cried out with a loud voice, That ſuch a thing had not been heard of, nor ever
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:98085:161"/>
happened before in the whole Empire of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> In ſhort, he was in ſuch a rage, that one would have ſworn, he would have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us all to be baniſhed into <hi>Siberia,</hi> as they ſometimes did an Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> and that having refuſed the Great Dukes preſent, they would make us hunt Sables in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which is the penalty of their greateſt malefactors. But that which moſt afflicted the Ambaſſador's Domeſticks, was the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they received by his refuſal, in being ſo deprived of the Honour of receiving ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable teſtimonies of the generoſity of ſo great a Prince. However we comforted our ſelves in the Prudence of the Ambaſſador, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though each of us was deceived in the hopes he had conceived, yet we could not for all that forbear praiſing the generoſity of his Conduct. Whereas on the other ſide <hi>Golozof</hi> in very great paſſion mounted his horſe, his footmen following him two and two, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Excellence took great pleaſure to behold them marching in that Order, and the indignation which they carried in their faces. Every one looked after them with a profound ſilence, imagining this refuſal ſo Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, that it affronted the Grandeur and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the <hi>Tzar,</hi> and that his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would not fail to take exemplary ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon an action ſo preſumptuouſly bold: others not knowing the cauſe ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:98085:161"/>
their judgments. The <hi>Tzar</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of this affair, and exceedingly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with it, called his Councel of State immediately, and was preſent there himſelf; the reſult of which was, that <hi>Volinskoy</hi> (one of the new Commiſſioners) was deputed to repair to his Excellence, to know the reaſon of this refuſal, which he performed with more mildneſs and diſcretion than we had occaſion to hope for. The Ambaſſador an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, that he was ſo far from doing it out of any contempt, that on the contrary he looked upon his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties Preſent as an effect of his great Generoſity, but that the acceptance thereof would oblige him too far. He acquainted him how his affairs ſtood, that his Embaſſy had had no ſucceſs, and that in this caſe it was not proper for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any favour from his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty till he had firſt received the Juſtice he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. That otherwiſe he ſhould have taken the leaſt favour from his hands as a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Ornament to himſelf and his family, and that ſtill he was ready (provided any good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might be taken with his affaires) to receive any teſtimony whatever of the <hi>Tzars</hi> affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This gave <hi>Volinskoy</hi> ſatisfaction in ſome meaſure, eſpecially when he underſtood after what manner <hi>Goloſof</hi> had brought the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, that is, without the knowledge of his Excellencies <hi>Priſtafs,</hi> who ought firſt to have
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:98085:162"/>
given him notice of the deſign, and thereby prevented the diſhonour of ſo publick a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal. So that <hi>Golozof</hi> had no recompence for all his pains, but a grave reprehenſion, for having wanted diſcretion in the diſcharge of this affair. On the other ſide the <hi>Tzar</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the Preſent which he had received at his firſt Audience from the Ambaſſador to him again, it was a Baſin and Ewer of Silver, parcel gilt, two wrought Silver Diſhes, and another Diſh of Silver parcel gilt alſo. His Excellence received it with this Complement; <hi>I give his Tzarskoy Majeſty thanks for this, and I receive it with as great kindneſs as if it had been a greater Preſent. I ſhall keep it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies by me, becauſe it hath had the honour to be in the Poſſeſſion of his Tzarskoy Majeſty.</hi>

               <p>In the mean time my Lord Ambaſſador at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a Regiment of horſe departed from <hi>Moſco</hi> the 24. of <hi>June</hi> about the Evening, with intention to retreat ſeaven Verſts that night from the Town.

The 10. in the afternoon we made 27. Verſts by water in twenty boats they had provided againſt our coming, ſo as (paſſing a ſmall Arm of the Lake <hi>Ilmin</hi> into which the River, that paſſes by <hi>Brunitze</hi> falls) we arrived within 3. Verſts of <hi>Novogorod</hi> the great. The 11. the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador made his Entry into <hi>Novogorod.</hi> The 12. we departed, and on the 13. we paſt 67. Verſts, 37. upon the <hi>Ilmin</hi> before noon by the favour of a good wind, and 30. after to a Town called <hi>Soltza</hi> upon the River <hi>Solognae</hi> which caſts it ſelf likewiſe into the Lake. The next day the Ambaſſador parted from
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:98085:163"/>
                  <hi>Soltza</hi> by land, and advanced 35. Verſts. The 17. he made his Entry into <hi>Pleſco,</hi> and the 20. at night he departed from thence. The 22. we arrived on the frontiers at <hi>Nihui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> a <hi>Village</hi> in <hi>Livonia,</hi> the 25. at <hi>Marien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> and the 3. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> at <hi>Riga.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Journey from <hi>Moſco</hi> to the frontiers (which was near two hundred leagues) was made under the conduct of two <hi>Priſtafs,</hi> one of them called <hi>Jvan Stepanovitz Telepniof,</hi> one of the great <hi>Dukes Stolnicks</hi> conveyed his Excellence and took care of our Carriages and proviſions to <hi>Novogorod,</hi> the other (called <hi>Simon Offonaſſevitz</hi>) conducted us from <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vogorod</hi> to the Caſtle of <hi>Nihuiſen</hi> upon the frontiers. The greateſt part of this Journey we made on horſback, except when we went by water from <hi>Brunitze</hi> to <hi>Novogorod,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Soltza.</hi> For which reaſon we had commonly threeſcore ſadle horſes in our company, beſides what were in out carriages which we had covered ſome to travail in, and ſome to retreat to at any time upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of rain. Beſides theſe we had three Coaches, one of the Ambaſſadors, and two of the grand <hi>Dukes,</hi> which he had the Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to ſend along with us as far as <hi>Livonia,</hi> principally for the accommodation of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen. For our baggage we had uſually two hundred wagons, but little ones ſuch as they
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:98085:163"/>
are in <hi>Moſcovie.</hi> Four times we changed them in our Journey, as likewiſe our ſadle horſes, at <hi>Twere,</hi> at <hi>Wiſny Volſock,</hi> and at <hi>Soltze,</hi> at <hi>Pleſco;</hi> We having always a party of <hi>Strelitz</hi> and another of our own attending the baggage. This manner of travailing on horſback had been very pleaſant, had not the ſadles been ſo hard and ſo high as they uſe them in that Country: but they were made in that faſhion, that moſt of us were in a ſhort time in as much torment as we could have been upon the wooden horſe.</p>
               <p>All the Lodging we had in this Journey, was like that of Soldiers in the fields or woods, under the ſhelter of our Tents or covered wagons; upon which conſideration, the <hi>Tzar</hi> had amongſt other things provided us with three tents, one for the Ambaſſador which coſt near five hundred crownes, another for the Counteſs, and the third for my Lord <hi>Morpeth.</hi> The tents were ſent before from place to place with the Kitchin, and the greateſt part of our baggage, and we making ordinarily 20 or 25 Verſts in the morning, and as much after dinner, they pitcht them where they found water, and fields convenient for ſo great a number both of horſes and men. So as his Excellence arriving with his train at the End of his ſtage found his Tents ready pitched, and his meat almoſt ready. At night his bed was made under his Tent: But moſt
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:98085:164"/>
part of the Gentlemen and Servants betook themſelves to their wagons, and the wagoners to the ground for a lodging.</p>
               <p>For what relates to our Victuals we ſuffered almoſt for want of chimneys, the ſame incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience we had done betwixt <hi>Vologda</hi> and <hi>Moſco.</hi> For beſids that we had generally no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Beef and Mutton, that was moſt comonly roaſted only by the Sun and ſmoak in ſome corner of the field where the Cooks had piched their Tents to avoide the wind. But our greateſt inconvenience was in our drink, being conſtrained to drink Mead or Quaz, that was heated and quite dead with the Carriage. Ice would have done very well to have revived it, but it was ſo precious at that time there was ſcarce enough for the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors Table. At <hi>Novogorod</hi> and <hi>Pleſco</hi> (of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter) we were very well treated, we had all ſorts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in abundance, and ſack amongſt the reſt coſt us nothing, but our paines to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.</p>
               <p>True it is, we met ſeveral difficulties in this Journey, and beſides thoſe I am ſpeaking of, we ſuffered with the greateſt impatience the perſecution of the flies. Yet in other reſpects it muſt be acknowledged, that our Journey was very pleaſant, if we conſider the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſnes of the weather, the advantage of travailing under the ſhadow of the Foreſts,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:98085:164"/>
for the moſt part covered with an incredible quantity of excellent Strawberries, beſides the delight of beholding the Rivers gliding tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough theſe vaſt wilderneſſes. We obſerved ſeven or eight Lakes alſo, of which the moſt conſiderable were the <hi>Ilmin,</hi> and the <hi>Sveto Ozero,</hi> which ſignifies as much as <hi>the holy Lake.</hi> In the middle of this latter there is an Iland encompaſſed with ſeveral other little ones, which appear like ſo many woods about it, and a fair Convent within it, which makes a very agreeable proſpect. As to the <hi>Ilmin,</hi> it is doubtleſs one of the goodlieſt Lakes in <hi>Europe,</hi> being about fifty miles in length, and thirty miles broad, ſo that when we paſt over it, we could ſee land but on one ſide of us. We had at that time a boat, that ſayled with a ſaile of Mat made of Bulruſhes. And this abundance of Lakes and Rivers, which gave us occaſion of admiring the beauty of the Country, gave us alſo a convenience not unneceſſary at this time, and that was oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of waſhing our ſelves, which we did very frequently in this journey, and amongſt the reſt in the <hi>Volga,</hi> which we croſſed once again at <hi>Twere.</hi> But foraſmuch as this Road is not ſo much uſed by Strangers, as the Road to <hi>Archangel,</hi> our habits appeared ſo unuſual to the Peaſants, that they no ſooner ſaw two or three of my Lords Servants on horſe-back, but away they run in all haſte to
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:98085:165"/>
their houſes, clapping their doors after them, as if we had been ſo many ominous Birds, or Spirits come on purpoſe to fright them; whereby it came to paſs that in caſe we wanted any thing, there was no hopes of being ſupplyed by them.</p>
               <p>And thus you have had what properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the manner of our Travails, I ſhall now ſpeak ſomething of the moſt remarkeable paſſages therein.</p>
               <p>It is a Maxime, it ſeemes, in the Court of <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> that the better to ſet off the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they beſtow upon Publique Miniſters, they muſt now and then abuſe and affront them, and as my Lord Ambaſſador was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Moſco</hi> according to this Rule, ſo the Court thought it expedient he ſhould be uſed after the ſame way at his departure. As to their Ceremony in conducting him out of Town, and his accommodation during his whole journey after, it muſt be acknowledged honorable enough, and to his Excellencies very great ſatisfaction. And indeed to ſpeak freely (conſidering the ardency wherewith his Excellence had proſecuted his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Propheſy of <hi>Pronchiſſof,</hi> who had told him, That the Great Duke would ſend him away without any honour at all) their civility was much greater than we had
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:98085:165"/>
reaſon to expect. However the Ambaſſador could not avoid the diſorder which happened at his departure from <hi>Moſco,</hi> upon occaſion of one <hi>Calthof,</hi> who had put himſelf amongſt his Gentlemen, with deſign to return into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> with them. This <hi>Calthof</hi> had been in the <hi>Tzars</hi> ſervice for ſome years, and the time for which he had obliged himſelf being expired, his Excellence interpoſed for his diſmiſſion, and obtained it. Nevertheleſs the <hi>Tzar</hi> having notice that he was going, he ſent a Meſſenger immediately after, as we were marching out of the Town, to recal him, and (which was the wonder) the Meſſenger did not loſe his way. The Ambaſſador not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it proper to oppoſe himſelf directly againſt the pleaſure of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, returns <hi>Calthof</hi> to him, but with expectation he ſhould be preſently releaſed. But five days afterwards being arrived at <hi>Twere,</hi> his Excellence underſtood they had upon a falſe pretence clapped him in Priſon, and uſed him very ill. For which cauſe he diſpatched a Poſt to <hi>Moſco</hi> with this Letter in <hi>Latin</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to <hi>Larivon Lopookin, Diack</hi> or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the Embaſſy-Office.</p>

eſteem it perhaps decorous, that my exit ſhould bear reſemblance with my Entry, and my laſt uſage be as diſobliging as my firſt.

I have often declared to the Lords of the Counſel, and to you my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor more eſpecially, that the time for which he had obliged himſelf to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty was expired, and for that reaſon I deſired his return. The Chancellor of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties Cabinet acquainted me he might go if he pleaſed, there ſhould be no impediment. But what is happened ſince You cannot be ignorant of. When I was even in my Journey, the principal clerk of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy-Office purſues me, and in his <hi>Tzars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy</hi> Majeſties name demands <hi>Calthof.</hi> Yet though I underſtood well the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and ſecurity was due to the dignity of an Ambaſſador, nevertheleſs leſt I ſhould ſeem upon ſlight occaſions and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably

How farr theſe injuries may extend I know not, nor even You Your ſelves that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive them. In the mean time I am moſt unhappy, who notwithſtanding my great Zeal and affection for the ſervice of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, muſt be conſtrained to return with this unwelcome tidings. This is a greater buſines than it appeares to be at firſt ſight, and in this <hi>Calthof</hi> the intereſt of all his moſt ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Subjects living in this Country is at ſtake, and it is a queſtion whether for the future they be to be eſteemed freemen or ſlaves.

               <p>This Letter was ſo farr from making any favourable impreſſions in the <hi>Tzar,</hi> that it exaſperated him to that heighth, he reſolved immediately to diſpatch an Ambaſſador to the King of <hi>England</hi> to complain of his Excellences proceedings. The deſign was principally taken upon a pleaſant miſtake on their ſide, of <hi>qui</hi> for <hi>quid.</hi> For this Expreſſion in the Letter, <hi>Quorſum haec vergant neſcio, neque vos ipſi ſcitis qui facitis,</hi> which ſignifyes as it is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, how farr theſe thing may extend I know not, nor You Your ſelves who contrive them, the Court of <hi>Muſcovie</hi> miſ-interpreted
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:98085:168"/>
it thus, <hi>I know not what may be the end of this buſines, nor do You know Your ſelves what You do.</hi> Which they conceived the higheſt piece of inſolence that he ſhould dare to ſay, the principal <hi>Boyars</hi> and Councellors of ſo great a Prince were ignorant and impertinent, as if they had done all things at random with out deliberation or reaſon. And this tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in appearance was <hi>Golozofs</hi> the great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Latin in that Court, and by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions they had played the Criticks ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely in the word <hi>Illuſtriſſimus,</hi> and who was much incenſt againſt the Ambaſſador, ſince his refuſal of the preſents. So as there might be ſome prejudice or malice in the tranſlation of the Letter.</p>
               <p>However it was we found the Governour of <hi>Twere</hi> in ſo ill an humor, he no ſooner heard the noiſe of our approach, but he ſhut up his gates immediately, as if the plague had been in the Country, ſo that we had nothing to truſt to, but the fields and the ſuburbs of the Town, near which in a plain we pitcht our Tents. The Town is built on the ſide of a hill, the <hi>Volga</hi> running by it, beſides another little River called <hi>Twere</hi> which denominates, the place. We ſtaied there only two whole days leaſt we ſhould diſturb the Governour too long, who with out doubt was impatient till he ſaw us departing.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Tarſock</hi> we had the divertiſement of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:98085:169"/>
ſeeing a very large Bear dance, it was ſo tame one might without any danger get upon his back, and ride up and down upon him in that poſture. At the ſame place our Chyrurgeon cut off with a Raiſor a finger of one of the Pages, which had gangren'd at <hi>Moſco</hi> by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a nayle wherewith he had unhappily hurt it.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Budeva</hi> we had the news of the great fire which happened on the 29. of <hi>June</hi> at <hi>Moſco</hi> (which was five days after we came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) conſuming a third part of the Town. I imagined immediately there was ſomething fatal ſtill in our departure, when I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the fire had happened at Archangel alſo ſome few days after we had left that Town. In like manner it was that <hi>Lot</hi> was preſerved, and all his family at the burning of <hi>Sodom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 10 of <hi>July</hi> Maſter <hi>Watſon</hi> who had been recalled by General <hi>Monke</hi> in our firſt Voiage came again to us at <hi>Brunitze,</hi> where we were arrived the day before. He came from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to <hi>Riga</hi> by Sea with ſome Equipage for the Ambaſſador, and paſt the reſt of the way to us by land. We were ſurpriſed at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, and very much delighted to ſee him again in <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> whoſe abſence had given us ſome regret. The occaſion of his return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us was chiefly, that he might have the ſatisfaction to travail with his Excellence the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:98085:169"/>
reſt of our Voiage thorough <hi>Moſcovy, Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Novogorod</hi> (which ſignifies New-town) my Lord Ambaſſador was received very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly. But his Excellence having juſt entred the Town, there was an unhappy accident befel an antient perſon of quality, that gave ſome interruption to the formality. He was very richly apparelled and well mounted, but being weak and his horſe unruly, he was fairly thrown down in the ſight of the whole Town, and received much hurt by his fall. At this <hi>Novogorod</hi> our <hi>Priſtaf</hi> from <hi>Moſco</hi> left us, and committed us to the care of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Offonaſſevitz,</hi> with direction to ſend back the <hi>Tzars</hi> Coaches and Tents, aſſoon as the Ambaſſador was arrived at the Frontiers. Which much troubled the Ambaſſador, to whom <hi>Volinskey,</hi> one of his Commiſſioners, had promiſed at <hi>Moſco,</hi> that the Tents ſhould attend him as far as <hi>Riga,</hi> in confidence of which promiſe his Excellence did not trouble himſelf to provide any at his own charges. Being diſappointed in this manner, and in no condition to accommodate himſelf otherwiſe in that place, no wonder if he expreſſed his diſſatisfaction, ſeeing himſelf leſt by this trick in a very ill poſture to travel from the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to <hi>Riga.</hi> This <hi>Novogorod</hi> hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly one of the greateſt and beſt fortified Townes in all <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> of which there are
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:98085:170"/>
ſtill ſome marks remaining round about the Town. But at preſent it is reduced, and of no great circumference, however by reaſon of the Commerce it injoies it is well peopled. The Lake <hi>Ilmin</hi> is within a League of the Town, out of which comes the <hi>Volka</hi> or <hi>Volgda,</hi> a very fair River that runs by the Town.</p>
               <p>But if we were well received at <hi>Novogorod,</hi> I muſt needs acknowledg the reception we had afterwards at <hi>Pleſco</hi> was not inferiour, as if the Governours of theſe two Towns had been emulous, which ſhould give hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Excellence the beſt entertainment. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs by the favour of two accidents the Governour of <hi>Pleſco</hi> had the advantage; The firſt was by the unadviſedneſs of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Pleſco,</hi> who had ſeiſed, the night before our Entry, upon two horſes belonging to the Ambaſſador's Train, having found them in the night in his poſſeſſions. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour was no ſooner informed of this action but he apprehended the Gentleman, and ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:98085:170"/>
hundred, under the Command of an one-eyed Serjeant. This tidings alarmed us a little, eſpecially when we were told, they had done much miſchief in that Province, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſeveral Villages. But the Governour of the Town in this caſe alſo manifeſted his Generoſity, and the particular care he had to oblige his Excellence: for he gave us a Convoy of five hundred foot well armed, to ſecure our bagage, and defend our perſons againſt the attempts of this terrible Cyclops: In this place the Ambaſſador ſtayed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of an anſwer from the Governour General of <hi>Livonia,</hi> by the return of the Meſſenger he had ſent on purpoſe to him from <hi>Moſco</hi> the 14. of <hi>June,</hi> and who had Order to meet him again at <hi>Pleſco.</hi> On the 19. of <hi>July,</hi> three days after we arrived there, the Meſſenger came to us with this Anſwer from Count <hi>Oxenſtern</hi> the Governour Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that he had already deputed two Officers to receive his Excellence on the Frontiers, and that he had Orders from the Crown of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> to defray the charges of his Carriages and Entertainment from thence to <hi>Riga.</hi> The Ambaſſador being ſurpriſed with the Civility of the offer, and with the particular care that Crown had taken to facilitate his paſſage thorough <hi>Livonia,</hi> prepared himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:98085:171"/>
before he came away obſerving <hi>Calthof</hi> was not returned, he ſent another Letter to <hi>Moſco,</hi> making mention of the Extraordinary enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment he had received from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of <hi>Novogorod</hi> and <hi>Pleſco,</hi> as alſo of the deſigne on foot for the Carrying back his Tents, and theſe were the very words of the Letter, which had the ſame ſuperſcription with the former.</p>

At this time (for it was about noon) there was a great debate where his Excellence ſhould dine, the cooks having not been able, for want of water, to get any thing ready. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Gentlemen preſſed the Ambaſſador to dine in the Caſtle of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huiſen.</hi> The <hi>Priſtaf</hi> oppoſed it very zealouſly, as well for the natural jealouſy betwixt the two Nations of <hi>Swedeland</hi> and <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> as for other reaſons. At laſt after much contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, in which the <hi>Priſtaf</hi> was very fierce, it was reſolved we ſhould paſs the Frontiers, and pitch our Tents by the ſide of a brook, under the Caſtle of <hi>Nihuiſen.</hi> The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor paſſed thither on horſ-back in a quarter of an hour, ſo that in a ſhort time his dinner was got ready.

After dinner they took their leaves of the Ambaſſador, and the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſent their Coaches to attend him into the Caſtle, where we were received with

when ever the Ambaſſador went on ſhore for his divertiſement, whilſt the Ship lay at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, they gave him alwaies four guns, at his going out, and as many when he came back.</p>
               <p>At laſt on the 22. we ſet ſayle, but it was only to make a League and an half, being forced to attend a proper wind to carry us, over certain Sand-banks, that lye in the Mouth of the River, ſo as we caſt anchor again near the Fort of <hi>Dunemund,</hi> where we continued two days, having the Shallop with us, in which our horſes were embarked.</p>
               <p>The 24. the Wind was favourable, ſo that we paſſed the Mouth of the River. Upon which the Ship ſaluted the Fort with four or five great Guns, and the Fort to requite us, gave us above forty, all laden with bullets which they directed with that ſkill, we could, hear moſt of them whiſtling betwixt our ſailes, and almoſt at the ſame time ſee them falling into the Sea at a great diſtance before us. Some there were among us, who not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of the dexterity of their Gunners, choſe rather to withdraw themſelves under Deck, than ſtand expoſed to the danger of behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them. For ſome time we ſayled by the Coaſt of <hi>Curland</hi> by the favour of the Wind; but towards night it turned ſo contrary, that,</p>
               <p>On the 26. we were enforced to caſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor by the <hi>Domeznez,</hi> which is a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Iland, by reaſon of many Sand-banks
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:98085:181"/>
that incompaſs it: for which cauſe there are conſtantly every night great fires made upon the Shores, for the direction of ſuch as are at Sea. And here it was we had time enough to diſcharge our ſelves of our proviſion, which was laid in but for ſix days, but what was remaining was ſo well managed by the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, we had wherewithall to ſubſiſt till we came on ſhore. For he retrenched his own Table, not only of ſuperfluities, but neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, confining himſelf to one ſmall meal in a day: true it is we had muſick enough to to ſupply our want of victuals. But moſt of us not being able to live upon Air and Wind like the Camelions, were glad to eat ſuch meat as the Captain of the Ship could furniſh us with, which by misfortune at that time was almoſt all corrupted. A ſtrange thing it was to find our ſelves in a ſtarving condition, in a Voiage only of an hundred Leagues, after we had paſt another of ſeven hundred and fifty, in great, plenty and abundance. We were in a ſtrait for every thing, as well as freſh meat; Beer and freſh water amongſt us were grown ineſtimable. And from hence it was, that his Excellence reſerving for his own Table that ſmall quantity of Beer he had left, he diſtributed freely to the greateſt part of his Domeſticks, a good proportion of his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine, which was to ſerve them inſtead of Beer. At firſt this Wine ſeemed to ſweeten
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:98085:182"/>
and alleviate the miſery they were in, but they quickly found it an aggravation rather: for there was nothing almoſt excited thirſt like it, and in a place where there was no poſſibility of getting any thing to aſſwage it. But by Providence it fared not ſo ill with our Shallop, for that no ſooner obſerved the extream violence of the Wind, but it returned immediately for <hi>Riga.</hi> And it was very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py it did ſo, otherwiſe it would have had much ado to have eſcaped the danger of a Storm that took us on the 28. at Night, which indeed was very terrible and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</p>
               <p>The 29. the Wind being ſomewhat fallen, we weighed anchor, with deſign to endeavour the doubling the Cape of <hi>Domeſnez,</hi> which we happily performed, and at night after a little calm the wind came about, and proved very favourable and propitious. So that beſides <hi>Domeſnez,</hi> we had the ſight of ſeveral other Ilands in this Voiage, as <hi>Runen, Abrick,</hi> and <hi>Ouzel.</hi> And it is this multitude of Iles, that makes Navigation ſo difficult in the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, for from thence it comes, that they meet every moment with Rocks, or Shelves, or banks of Sand. And foraſmuch as many Tacks muſt be made to avoid them, there is ordinarily a neceſſity of ſeveral winds to make a very ſmall Voiage. Upon which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration amongſt others, his Excellence
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:98085:182"/>
choſe rather to ride three daies at anchor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Domeſnez,</hi> expoſed to the extremities of the weather, than to return to <hi>Riga,</hi> and loſe the advantage of the progreſs he had made already.</p>
               <p>The 31. we arrived at the Rocks, called the <hi>Shares,</hi> where we found a paſſage betwixt the high rocks, ſo ſtrait, there was ſcarce room enough for our ſhip, ſo as we were in all points in diſtreſs. When we had paſt that place, we caſt anchor, attending another Wind proper to carry us to <hi>Stockholm</hi> tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the reſt of the Rocks. In the mean time the Ambaſſador diſpatched Mr. <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>el</hi> his Secretary, and Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> his Steward in the Boat to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> from whence we were then not above ſeven <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles, or fourteen <hi>French</hi> Leagues. The Secretary was ſent to give notice of the Ambaſſadors arrival, and to inform himſelf at what time he was to make his Entry into the Town. Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> was to prepare his Houſe, and to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Victuals, through ſcarcity of which, we were at this time reduced to ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.</p>
               <p>The firſt of <hi>September</hi> we advanced ſome Leagues amongſt the Rocks, which divided the Sea into ſeveral Channels, as they had been ſo many Rivers: And as the paſſages are very narrow, ſo we found ſeveral pieces of Ships that had been wreckt there. But
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:98085:183"/>
that which ſeemed moſt ſtrange to me was, that I obſerved moſt of theſe Rocks almoſt covered with trees, though I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any ſubſtance, that could give them Nouriſhment, and where their Roots could faſten; for there is nothing to be diſcerned, but ſolid matter and entire ſtone.</p>
               <p>The next morning betimes, the Maſter of the Ceremonies came aboord our Ship, to ſignify to the Ambaſſador from their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, the King and Queen Mother, the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction they received at his arrival. But before he could deliver his Complement, we eſcaped <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ery narrowly from being caſt away. For having weighed our anchors in the morning, to take advantage of the wind that was ſomething fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, the Pilot doubling a point to gain the greater benefit by it, the Veſſel on a ſudden ran ſo near the Rocks; the Pilot in a great fright was forced to tack immediately with all the dexterity he was able, which was not ſo great, but the Ship ſtruck with her Poop as ſhe was turning about. But by the Grace of God it was done without any other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief than a concuſſion, that waked and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted too, all that were then aſleep in the Ship. After this our Veſſel was managed ſo well, that at length we gained the point that was ſo near deſtroying us, and came to anchor within a League of <hi>Stockholm.</hi> At this time the Maſter of the Horſe, who was arrived

And whereas in that the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> made demonſtration only of their Grandeur and Vanity; The <hi>Swedes</hi> in this made no other expreſſion, but of Kindneſs &amp; Civility. Their Artillery, which is ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the wars, was become here the grateful Proclaimer of Peace and Affection, nothing being to be heard about the Town for an hour together, but the noiſe of their Cannon and great Guns. For aſſoon as the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor had left the ſhip, and was entered with his Train into the Boats, that were ſent him by the King, the Fregat gave us a whole round with his Cannon, and whilſt we were making for the ſhore, they ſaluted him with many from land, ſo that they made a very

ſtrange clattering amongſt the Rocks. As we paſt along, we had the ſight of a Diver, that came up out of a place twenty fathoms deep, into which they let him down out of a ſhallop with a Cord, to look for the Guns of a Man of War, that had been caſt away there. He was clad all in leather, and ſate under a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Engine, ſomething like a bell, in which he ſaid himſelf, he had ſpace enough to breathe, the water comming no higher than his breaſt. After this we came to a Bridg covered over with Carpets of Tapeſtry, at which place his Excellence was comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented from their Majeſties by one of the principal Senators. And from thence he was conveyed in the Kings Coach, to a Houſe ſet a part for Ambaſſadors, Their Majeſties having joyned ſeveral of their Gentlemen, Pages, and Footmen to his Train.

His Majeſty my Maſter rejoyces ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly in the happy conſtitution of all Your affaires, and under God attributes it much to Your Majeſties Prudence, that in the conjuncture of ſo young a King, yet there is no poſsibility of other contention here, then that decent conteſt, whether You or the Kingdom have a greater ſhare in Him.

               <p>This Complement his Excellencies Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary immediately interpreted into <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord Ambaſſador after this Audience imploied moſt of that little time he had to ſtay in that Court, in bringing the Amity and Alliance between theſe two Crowns to a nearer and firmer Connexion. And this was the reaſon he had ſeveral conferences with the principal Miniſters of that Kingdom both in publick and private. Amongſt other things he intimated the deſign the King his Maſter had to enter into a ſtrict League with that Crown and the Kingdom of <hi>Danemark,</hi> he demonſtrated the great advantages would accrue thereby, and that without doubt the ſecurity of the three Kingdoms of <hi>England, Swedeland,</hi> and <hi>Danemark</hi> would principally depend thereupon. That for this reaſon his Majeſty of great <hi>Britain</hi> deputed two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in quality of his Envoies Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, one to this Court, and the other into <hi>Dane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:98085:190"/>
to the end this affair might be brought to a happy Concluſion. The deſign was acceptable enough in this Court, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies expreſſed a great inclination of uniting themſelves more ſtrictly with the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> And as there ſeems to be naturally betwixt the two Nations of <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a kindneſs and propenſity one to the other, ſo was it very material, that ſo good a principle ſhould be actuated and imployed, and that Art might give perfection to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>His Excellence interceded likewiſe in the behalf of ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that either had there ſome buſineſs of concernment, or that deſired ſome favour or other. And in this reſpect alſo my Lord Ambaſſador found this Court ſo favourable, that he was ſooner weary of aſking, than they were of gratifying his Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>There being at <hi>Stockholm</hi> three Reſidents, one from <hi>France,</hi> the other from <hi>Danemark,</hi> and the third from <hi>Holland,</hi> his Excellence had ſeveral Conferences with each of them, and treated them afterwards one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all honourable entertainment.</p>
               <p>In the mean time his Excellence had the honour to be regaled by their Majeſties, the King and Queen Mother, in a moſt obliging manner, in a ſmall Palace ſome few Leagues from <hi>Stockholm;</hi> where aſſoon as he was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,

                  </gap>ities in the Caſtle, he was carried to Dinner with the King and the Queen Mother. The King drank to the Ambaſſador the King of <hi>Englands</hi> health, but drinking it with more zeal than ordinary, and the glaſs being too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ig, it hapned he ſpilt a good part of the Wine upon his cloths; which put his Majeſty ſo out of countenance, that he looked as he would willingly have drunk it again with more caution, if by that means he could have got that diſaſter forgotten. After Dinner his Excellence went a hunting in a fair Park well ſtocked with Deer. The King was there on Horſ-back alſo, and obſerving his Excellence ſcrupulous of ſhooting a large Deer that was within his reach, he aſked him why he did not ſhoot, who anſwering, that a ſmaller Deer would be ſufficient for him; the King replyed he ſhould take no care for that, if he left but one he might diſpoſe of the reſt as he pleaſed. At length his Excellence retired after a long chaſe, he being forced to ſhoot 2. or 3. times before the Doe would fall, and being of his own killing, it was ſent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to his houſe.</p>
               <p>Some few days after there was a great Ball at which my Lord Ambaſſador was deſired to be preſent: where we had opportunity to ſee the great Gallants of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs

As ſoon as he was arrived he was preſented with the Collation &amp; excellent muſick, after that he had the diverſion for half an hour to ſee nine Earles run at the Ring in his preſence with great agility and addreſs. From thence he was attended to the Table, where he found enough to indulge every one of his ſences, they remaining almoſt four hours at the Table.

it was the ſincerity of my Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors diſcourſe that produced this effect, and that it being too great a taſk for him to repreſent to the Queen, the great honour his Maſter the King of <hi>England</hi> had for her, and the great ſence himſelf had of the Favours which he had received from her Majeſty, his Speech had failed him, according to that ſaying of <hi>Seneca, Curae leves loquuntur, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentes ſtupent; Small cares may be expreſſed, great ones are unutterable.</hi> But when I ſaw the Secretary fall himſelf upon the ſame rock, and ſtop in the ſame place when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted the Complement in <hi>French,</hi> then I concluded the thing had been ſo contrived.

he would ſignify to her Siſter the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> with what zeal She honoured her Perſon and Virtues, and what delight She took in her proſperity; And laſtly, That her Majeſty was very well pleaſed with the generous Comportment of the Ambaſſador, and that ſhe had a very great eſteem of his Perſon and merits.</p>

And whilſt he was attending till the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> came within ſhot before he gave fire, we perceived them take it down as we were juſt at an anchor. A quarter of an hour after the <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſel paſſed by our Ship and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted us with five piece of Cannon, which our Captain returned with three of thoſe he had laden with bullet, which he ordered to be ſhot over them into the Air. The <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> after that gave us three more, which we anſwered again with one, and ſo we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. After this the Ambaſſador ſent his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary into the Town, to give notice of his arrival, and to carry his Credentials to the Chancellor. Whereupon the King ſent his Vice-Admiral the ſame night, to let his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence underſtand, with how much joy he received the news of his arrival, and withall to aſſure him that he might make his Entry the next day into the City. At the ſame time Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot,</hi> who was but lately arrived in that Court from his Majeſty of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> in the Quality of Envoy Extraordinary, came alſo to ſalute his Excellence. The Vice-Admiral &amp; the Envoy came together in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fair Barge, in which, being it was night, the Ambaſſadors Lady took the opportunity to go with them into the Town. And though it was very late, and our Ship at anchor about two leagues from the ſhore, her Ladyſhip choſe rather to expoſe her ſelf for ſome time

               <p>The next day we were very near being caſt away in the very harbour. For we ſtruck <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o deſperately upon the ground, that inſtead of making our ſolemn Entry into the Town, we had much ado to ſave our Veſſel from a Wreck. After we had weighed anchor about noon to come up to the Town according to the Vice-Admirals Orders (who had ſent us two Pilots for that purpoſe from <hi>Copenhagen</hi>) we were ſo ill ſteered by them, that we ran on ground immediately, and that with ſuch violence, that our Ship was above a foot deep in the ſand. Whereupon the Captain ordered our ſailes to be furled and two piece of Cannon to be ſhot off, to give notice of our Condition to the Town. A while after which the Vice-Admiral himſelf arrived with ſome Boats full of Anchors and Cables, by means of which good office we diſ-ingaged our ſelves by that time it was night, and came to ſeven fathoms water. And if on the one ſide the Malevolence or neglect of thoſe two <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Pilots was ſo dreadful, on the other ſide we found the Heavens favouring us excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in ſending us a Calm on a ſudden, after a violent and impetuous wind that had blown very hard till then, ſo that we came off without any other hurt than a great affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

And indeed had the wind continued as ſtrong as it had been before, in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance there had been no ſaving of our Ship, and perhaps we ſhould have had much ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Excellencies Entry how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was put off till the next day, by reaſon the Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> (Mr. <hi>de Treſlona</hi> Knight of <hi>Maltha</hi>) who was lately arrived at <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and was not as yet removed from the Houſe reſerved for Ambaſſadors, ſince he made his Entry. And upon this ſcore it was, that the Vice-Admiral was diſpatched to his Excellence to excuſe this delay.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 27. of <hi>October</hi> my Lord Ambaſſador made his ſolemn Entry with great Magnificence. And if from thence a judgment might be made of their Friendſhip to his Majeſty of great <hi>Britain,</hi> we might without all ſcruple conclude, that the Amity of this Court in that reſpect exceeded the affection of the <hi>Swedes.</hi> In the firſt place two noble Gallies and a Galliot came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Excellence and his Train: for the wind was come about ſo croſs, that it was impoſſible to get our Ship up into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

intending to ſet out twenty Men of War at the begining of the Spring, with nine hundred and fourſcore or a thouſand pieces of Cannon, and five thouſand good Seamen and Soldiers beſides Officers, it would be neceſſary, that five and twenty thouſand Crowns extraordinary ſhould be paid him at leaſt, beſides what charges he ſhould be forced to be at himſelf to maintain them at Sea.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> inſiſted, that his Majeſty would endeavour that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould declare himſelf as to the Union propoſed, and that nothing ſhould be tranſacted in this matter without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and conſent.</p>
               <p>And this being all we have to ſay of the Ambaſſadors Negotiation, it follows that we ſay ſomething of his manner of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Court, which was almoſt the ſame as at <hi>Stockholm</hi> in Feaſts and Treatments. For, beſides the Entertainments of the three firſt daies after his arrival, (which ſome charged of having ſomewhat in them of the Bacchanalian air) there were ſeveral othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> feaſts, as particularly, when his Excellence treated Mr. <hi>de Treſlon</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, of whom I have ſpoken before. From which time there was ſo great a friendſhip betwixt the two Ambaſſadors, as would have made one admire to behold the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:98085:212"/>
frankneſs and civilities which paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. They viſited one another very frequently, and that by ſurprize ſometimes, and treated one another with all imaginable Reſpect and Courtſhip. Mr. <hi>Treſlon</hi> being the firſt of the two at <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> made the firſt Viſit to my Lord Embaſſador, who met him at the outward Gate next the ſtreet, giving him the precedence and right hand whilſt he was in his houſe, which was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe obſerved by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador when his Excellence viſited him, and this was the commmon reception they uſed to one another. The buſineſs of that Embaſſy from the King of <hi>France</hi> was for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of a League, which was in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action betwixt that King and the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> And it extended no further, than a bare treaty of Amity for the ſecurity of both the Allies, and (as my Lord Ambaſſador was aſſured) aimed not at the prejudice of any Prince, much leſs of the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> who was expreſly compriſed therein, and might have been received into the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance if he pleaſed himſelf. Mr. <hi>de Treſlon</hi> ſtaid in this Court not above three weeks, and on the fifteenth of <hi>November</hi> he departed from <hi>Copenhagen</hi> for <hi>Stockholme,</hi> where he had another Embaſſy to make from the King his Maſter. But beſides the feaſting that was occaſioned by the intimacy of theſe two
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:98085:213"/>
Ambaſſadors, there was one more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily remarkable on the ſeventeenth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> which was at the Chriſtening the child of my Lady Ambaſſadreſs, who was brought to bed about a fortnight before of a Son. It was Chriſtened by the King, the Queen, and his Royal Highneſs, and was named <hi>Frederick Chriſtian,</hi> on a Sunday at night in the Houſe where his Excellence reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. As ſoon as our Chaplain had adminiſtred the Baptiſm according to the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the King went to ſalute my Lady Ambaſſadreſs in her Chamber, which was near the Room where the Infant was Baptized. The Queen accompanied the King in this Viſit, his Royal Highneſs with the two Princeſſes his Siſters &amp; ſeveral Ladies of the Court following them. There were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the chief Miniſters of State came in alſo to congratulate her Ladiſhip upon her happy delivery. From this Viſit their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties paſt into a large Room, where his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence had prepared a Noble and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Collation for them. The King would not ſit down, but chooſe rather to ſtand on one ſide of the table, as her Majeſty did alſo on the other, with the Prince <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and the two Princeſſes. His Majeſty continued bare all the while, drinking ſeveral Healths with the Ambaſſador and other great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his Court, amongſt which, the Lord
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:98085:213"/>
Treaſurer (who had been lately his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador to the King of <hi>England</hi>) was one. My Lord <hi>Morpeth,</hi> his excellence's Son, entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Queen all the time, his Excellence taking only now and then opportunity to addreſs himſelf to her Majeſty. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Pages that were attending on his Majeſty were in the ſame Room, where they alſo had their ſhare of this Entertainment as well as the reſt of the more inferiour ſervants who remained in the Court below. At length after about half an hours time, his Majeſty retired with the Ambaſſador wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon him. Three daies after his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence treated his Royal Highneſs again very ſumptuouſly, and after dinner, His Highneſs was pleaſed to divert himſelf in dancing ſome howers with his Excellence and his principal Gentlemen. Beſides theſe Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſome others which I pretermit, his Excellence had two or three daies recreation in hunting the Hare with his Royal Highneſs. At other times he took a ſurvey of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was moſt remarkable in the City, and amongſt other things the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> and ſome other magazins for their Anmunition &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of War. At our entrance into the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> which we found very fine and in good order, we were ſurpriſed at firſt, to ſee a Coach paſſing before us, as it were by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar motion of its own: but the motion was
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:98085:214"/>
performed by wheel-work with a kind of rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſteer it. For which purpoſe, there were two men placed ſecretly within it, one to turn the wheels (which was the reaſon it moved) and the other to manage the Stern. They ſhewed his Excellence the Rarities alſo in the Kings Pallace, which were ſeveral very curious pieces of Mechanicks, beſides many Curioſities brought from the remoteſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The Rareties were diſpoſed in five or ſix ſeveral appartements on one floor, and indeed were the only obſervable things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt we ſaw in that Pallace. Amongſt other things, in one of theſe appartements we had a ſight of an excellent piece of Art, which was a little Ship, ready rigged, whoſe Maſt, Ladders, Sailes and Cannon were all of Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But his Majeſty having a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to careſs his Excellence, he thought good to ſhew him his Pallace at <hi>Frederixburgh</hi> which without contradiction is is a moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent and exact Pile.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the King had the Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to go and ſee the Man of War which brought his Excellence from <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and was then at Anchor in the Harbour atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his departure. This Viſit being made of a ſuddain, and in the abſence of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and the greateſt part of the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Ship, the Seamen were at no ſmall loſs to receive his Majeſty as he ought
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:98085:214"/>
to have been. Nevertheleſs that hindered not but his Majeſty left ſome tokens of his being there, by a conſiderable Preſent which he ſent to the Captain and all the Seamen. The Captain at his return, being deſirous to publiſh his Majeſties generoſity, thought he could not do it any waies more remarkably than by firing his great Guns, which though in the Night, he diſcharged ſo freely at his return to his ſhip, that the noiſe gave the Town an alarm immediately, the drums beating through the ſtreets, and all people running to their Arms, till at laſt they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the occaſion, and turned their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions into laughter.</p>
               <p>About this time my Lord Ambaſſador had advertiſement from <hi>Moſco,</hi> amongſt other things, that <hi>Calthof</hi> (who was detained by the <hi>Tzar</hi> after our departure) was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to re-engage himſelf for two Years in the Great Dukes ſervice. He had notice like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty had diſpatched an Ambaſſador to the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> to complain of him as a perſon that had been deficient in his reſpects to the <hi>Tzar</hi> and his principal <hi>Boyars</hi> in the whole proceſs of his Negotiation. But the Ambaſſador having from time to time ſent Copies into <hi>England</hi> of all that had paſſed betwixt him and the Commiſſioners, and being otherwiſe well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, that the King his Maſter did well
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:98085:215"/>
approve of what he had done, he troubled not himſelf with what the <hi>Tzar</hi> ſhould attempt, being very well aſſured (as indeed it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards happened) that all his efforts would not be able to ſhake the reaſon and juſtice upon which his conduct was founded.</p>
               <p>About the latter end of our Reſidence there, there was a publick combat performed in the preſence of the King, with portable Pumps, or Engins, ſuch as are uſed frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the quenching of great fires. It was managed before the Pallace, betwixt ſix or ſeven men one againſt another, having ſeveral others appointed for the management of their Pumps, and for ſupplying them with water from the Canal. Every one diſcharged upon his adverſary by lifting up the Pipe, and levelling it againſt his Enemy, expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the force of the Engins within fifteen or ſixteen paces, and plying their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſo well, that they left one of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions but one eye to guide him back again to his Houſe.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Morpeth</hi> departed for <hi>England</hi> on the firſt day of <hi>Dicember</hi> with four or five Gentlemen and ſome Footmen in his retinue. His Excellence ſent him by Land, that he might have the advantage of ſeeing ſome remarkable places in the way betwixt <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> but eſpecially in <hi>Flanders</hi> thorough which his deſign was to paſs.

               <p>ON the fifteenth of <hi>December,</hi> four days after the Audience of <hi>Congé,</hi> his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence embarqued, and the next day we came to an Anchor before <hi>Elſinore</hi> (ſix <hi>Dutch</hi> miles from <hi>Copenhagen</hi>) where we lay, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Eaſterly wind.</p>
               <p>About this time the Publick Peace began
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:98085:221"/>
to be broke betwixt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> acts of Hoſtility being committed on both ſides, &amp; though the War was not as yet formally declared, yet the Goods and Perſons of either Nation were ſubject to the outrages and depredations of War. Which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, without doubt would have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have made us apprehenſive of ſome diſaſtrous event in our voiage, had not, our earneſt deſire of ſeeing <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and the advantage we had of being in a Man of War ſo well provided taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all impreſſions of fear. True it is we had daily advice of five or ſix <hi>Dutch</hi> men of War, which lay to watch for us in the way, and doubtleſs for his Excellences ſake, would have done their utmoſt to have taken us. Yet the greateſt part of us thought little of being taken, and expected rather to catch ſome prey or other.</p>
               <p>For want of a fair wind we lay ſix dayes at Anchor before <hi>Elſinore,</hi> ſo that we had time enough to take a view of the Town, and the Caſtle which ſecures the ſame very well. In the mean time we had news of his <hi>Tzarkskoy</hi> Majeſties Ambaſſadors arrival at <hi>London,</hi> and with what coldneſs he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the King, who immediately gave him to underſtand his reſentment of the ſmall ſatisfaction his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty had given him in that honourable &amp; ſplendid Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:98085:222"/>
which his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty had received from him. And it being about this time we made the firſt diſcovery of the great Comet that then appeared in <hi>Europe,</hi> one of us took occaſion to ſay, That the Great Dukes Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador had already found the effects of it.</p>
               <p>At length on the 23 of that moneth very early in the morning we departed from <hi>Elſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore.</hi> We were ſcarce advanced twenty leagues in our way, but the wind turned about &amp; came croſs as before, ſo that we were forced back to <hi>Elſinore.</hi> My Lord Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor obſerving the uncertainty he was in, and that he was become the paſtime of wind and Sea, believed it his moſt expedient courſe to travail by Land. The indignation he had againſt lying idle ſo long in a place, and the Impatience of remaining in ſo tedious a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, perſwaded him to a reſolution of leaving the Sea, and making his journey by Land, in caſe the Wind did not turn favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able within four and twenty hours. But the wind blew ſo ſtrong from the ſhore, that it was not poſſible for us to land, much leſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in our Voiage by Sea. So that it ſeemed, that not the Sea only, but the Heavens and the Earth alſo had ſet themſelves in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Ambaſſadors deſign.</p>
               <p>And on the 28. we had a ſtorm ſo diſmal by reaſon of the obſcurity of a very dark night, that we were very much amazed to
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:98085:222"/>
find our ſelves the next morning at anchor near an Iland about two leagues further from <hi>Elſinore</hi> than we were before.</p>
               <p>The 29. the wind not being ſo high as it had been before, his Excellence prepared for his departure by Land, taking only nine of his Domeſticks with him, and leaving the reſt with his Lady, who made her Voiage by Sea. I was one of the nine that attended on the Ambaſſador, and am for that reaſon obliged to give a general account of the manner and occurrences of his Excellencies Journey.</p>
               <p>Firſt we croſſed the Iland of <hi>Sealand</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to <hi>Fredrixburgh,</hi> ſo that we arrived at <hi>Coſſor</hi> the laſt day of the year. The next, being New-years day, we paſſed from <hi>Sealand</hi> to the Iſle of <hi>Funhen</hi> (which was four <hi>Dutch</hi> miles) in a Galliot, and the ſame day advanced eight miles further croſs the Iland. The next day, from <hi>Funhen</hi> we arrived in <hi>Holſtein,</hi> making two miles in a Fiſher-boat, and from thence by <hi>Alderſleven</hi> and <hi>Frentsburgh</hi> we arrived at <hi>Hamborough.</hi> From <hi>Hamborough</hi> by <hi>Bockstoud</hi> we came to <hi>Bremen,</hi> and from <hi>Bremen</hi> into <hi>Weſt falia,</hi> ſo that we arrived at <hi>Munſter</hi> on the eleventh of <hi>January.</hi> From <hi>Munſter</hi> we came to <hi>Cologne</hi> upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> from <hi>Cologne</hi> to <hi>Malines</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and from <hi>Malines</hi> to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> on the 22. From <hi>Bruſſels</hi> in ſix days we came to <hi>Calais,</hi> taking <hi>Alſt,

Gaunt, Bruges, Newport, Dunkirk,</hi> and <hi>Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> by the way. From <hi>Calais</hi> to <hi>Dover</hi> we made ſeven leagues by Sea, from <hi>Dover</hi> we came poſt to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and from thence on the 30. of <hi>January</hi> up the <hi>Thames</hi> to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conſideration of the State of the times in which this journey was taken, made his Excellence travail about in this manner, rather than follow his direct road thorough <hi>Holland,</hi> which had been the ſhorter cut. And becauſe we were to paſs near the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, the Ambaſſador thought good alſo to conceal his Quality, and travel <hi>incognito,</hi> eſpecially after he was out of the Dominions of the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> by which means he avoided at the ſame time another incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, which was the Receptions and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonies, which his Dignity without doubt would have drawn upon him in his jorney, which would have much retarded him in his deſign of making all poſſible haſte into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whither the King his Maſter had recall'd him. In obedience to which, his Excellence ſo much inforced himſelf, that from the day of our ſetting forth, to our arrival at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne</hi> we travelled very often eight <hi>Dutch</hi> miles or ſixteen leagues a day, and ſo we were forced many times to travel in the night alſo, In the mean time the weather, which was rainy at our ſetting out from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen,</hi>

                  </hi> was ſo frozen and covered with ſnow, that it would have indured any kind of load whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The ſame day we departed from <hi>Hamburg,</hi> we were ſurprized with an accident at <hi>Bock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoud,</hi> a Town depending on the Crown of <hi>Sweden.</hi> For being upon the point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting after dinner, and having hired freſh waggons to make three or four leagues that night, it hapned that the Secretaries wago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner would not ſtir, unleſs there might go along with him another wagoner his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, who would have been as uſeleſs to us as his waggon. The Secretary not able to bring him to reaſon by fair means, tried what he could do by foul, and by clapping a piſtol to his head would have forced him along with him. But immediately his piſtol was wreſted from
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:98085:224"/>
him, and as they were putting themſelves into a poſture to abuſe him, we interpoſed ſo effectually, that he was reſcued out of the hands of a barbarous rout of peaſants and Mechanicks. But whilſt the Secretary was going to the Governour to deſire him to take ſome order in the caſe, we found the reſt of us beſet by above a hundred of them, ſome of them endeavouring to rob us of our goods, and others to do violence to our perſons; ſo that beſides a little Spaniel which they ſtole from us, we loſt four or five of our fire arms. Amongſt the reſt we had a Page loſt his Periwig in the Combat, and having then a garment on in the faſhion of the <hi>Samojedes,</hi> which for better reſiſtance of the weather, he made no ſcruple to wear in his travels, he lookt in that habit ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like a Chriſtian, that the rable took particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar delight to toſs him up and down with his Furs in the ſnow. His Excellence that was but juſt gone before, being ſurpriz'd with the alarm of the skirmiſh, came back there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and at length the buſineſs was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but ſo, that whereas we had uſually five waggons before, we went from hence but with four, and the Page made the reſt of his voiage without his Periwig. The manner of our Treatment at this place per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded us very ſtrongly, that the Ambaſſador was not known in this Town, in which we
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:98085:225"/>
found the People ſo unkind, that we might perhaps with as much reaſon call it <hi>Ponero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> as that to which <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> gave that name, being inhabited only by a ſort of rude and raſkally People.</p>
               <p>The next day being arrived at <hi>Bremen</hi> we underſtood by the Gazette that my Lord <hi>Morpeth</hi> was priſoner at <hi>Weſel,</hi> and that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had taken him and his Train, ſome two or three miles from <hi>Munſter</hi> in his way to <hi>Cologne.</hi> True it is the Gazette made not mention of his name, but all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the news were clear indications to us, that it was his Lordſhip whom it meant: which his Excellence applied to himſelf as a dangerous Omen. And having deſigned to follow him upon the ſame Road he took all poſſible care to avoid the like misfortune; for which cauſe he had a particular care to make a ſhort ſtay in every Town, and to aſſume only the bare title of a Gentleman. In which act one might have ſaid, his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſeemed as well to repreſent the perſon of the King his Maſter in his Exile, as he had lately done in the Pomp and Splendour of his Reſtoration.</p>
               <p>In ſhort we were no ſooner arrived at <hi>Munſter,</hi> three days after our departure from <hi>Bremen,</hi> but we underſtood the truth of the News, and all the circmſtances of my Lord <hi>Morpeth</hi>'s being betrayed in that Town. For
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:98085:225"/>
by accident we lay in the very ſame Inn he had lain in before us. And becauſe it was very eaſy for us to have been diſcovered by the Liveries, though the ſame were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſguiſed, to prevent all intelligence that might be given to the Governour of <hi>Weſel,</hi> his Excellence thought good to remove with all ſpeed from <hi>Munſter,</hi> leſt we ſhould be ſurpriſed in the ſame manner. So that we ſtaid at <hi>Munſter</hi> not above four or five hours, which Expedition was ſo fortunate to us, that we eſcaped the like danger thereby. After we were gone a day or two's journey from the Frontiers, we were not much ſollicitous any more, unleſs it were in our paſſage betwixt <hi>Calais</hi> and <hi>Dover:</hi> but his Excellence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged this Voiage with that prudence and caution, that at laſt we arrived very happily in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Rocheſter</hi> we underſtood that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors Lady was arrived at London, fifteen days before, and as for himſelf, that the Court did not expect his coming ſo ſoon after they knew the condition of my Lord <hi>Morpeth.</hi> Inſomuch that the Court was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſurpriſed with his arrival, as they were ſoon after with that of his Son, who arrived three days after my Lord his Father, the States having releaſed him and his Train, after ſome days confinement at <hi>Weſel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:98085:226"/>The Ambaſſador being returned to <hi>London</hi> in this manner, went immediately to pay his Duty to his Majeſty, carrying with him the Letter which the <hi>Tzar</hi> had delivered him at <hi>Moſco.</hi> The King having firſt ſignified the ſatisfaction he received to ſee him returned from ſo long a Voiage, at length amongſt other things ſpake to him about the Embaſſy which he had lately received from the <hi>Tzar,</hi> and commanded him in order to his juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to give in writing a Narrative of all that had paſſed relating to himſelf in his firſt Embaſſy: Which he performed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Ambaſſador that brought the accuſation againſt him. And for fear I ſhould leave this work imperfect, I thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to adjoyn to it my Lords Apology; for without doubt it would have been a great <hi>indecorum,</hi> having brought the Reader thus far, to leave him in ſuſpence in a buſineſs of ſo great Importance. True it is, the moſt things that are contained in it have been mentioned by me before, yet there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſages alſo which I reſerved for this place, to give the Reader more ſatisfaction and entertainment.

together, being inforced to hire them at his own expence from <hi>Arſinoa</hi> to <hi>Yagriſh.</hi> Which money indeed, at the Ambaſſadors depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Moſco</hi> was repaid him.</p>
               <p>Further, the <hi>Stolnick Offonaſſy Evanovich Neſtrof,</hi> and the <hi>Diack Evan Stepanovich Davidof</hi> coming to <hi>Vologda</hi> as new <hi>Priſtaves</hi> to conduct the Ambaſſador to <hi>Moſco,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Stolnick</hi> at his firſt coming to the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, ſaid to him, that His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty had ordered them and the Ambaſſador to come to <hi>Moſco,</hi> naming themſelves before the Ambaſſador.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the ſaid <hi>Stolnick</hi> refuſed abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to furniſh the Gentlemen with ſledds convenient, and would only allow them ſuch bare ſledds as are uſed by the common <hi>Mouſicks,</hi> ſo that the Ambaſſador was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to buy thoſe ſledds for the Gentlemen with his own money.</p>
               <p>Alſo the ſaid <hi>Stolnick</hi> was ſo ſtrict in matters of proviſion, that the Ambaſſador was refuſed one ſingle egg for his uſe, the <hi>Chalavalnicks</hi> or Purveyors alledging that they durſt not do it without the ſaid <hi>Stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks</hi> order, and that they durſt not wake him.</p>
               <p>Beſides, at <hi>Yeroſlaf, Troitza,</hi> and other places upon the way, the Ambaſſador was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily detained ſeveral daies from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding on his journey to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:98085:228"/>And at laſt, the Ambaſſador being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the <hi>Yaws,</hi> ſome four <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles from <hi>Moſco,</hi> and having ſtaid there two days, was overnight upon the fourth of <hi>February</hi> told by the ſaid <hi>Stolnick,</hi> that he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for his entring into <hi>Moſco</hi> the next day, and therefore deſired him to be ready by nine a clock in the morning, which he was. Nevertheleſs he and his whole retinue were ſtaid all the next day at the <hi>Yaws</hi> till four in the evening, without any meat or drink, or the leaſt refreſhment whatſoever, and at that unſeaſonable hour, orders came for their going on to <hi>Moſco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And being more than half way thither, then came new orders, that the Ambaſſador ſhould not make his Entry that night but turn into a village yet worſe than the <hi>Yaws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There came that night to the Ambaſſador the <hi>Diack Lookian Timopheovich Golozof</hi> from the <hi>Tzar,</hi> laying the fault upon the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, ſent with orders from <hi>Moſco,</hi> who he ſaid miſt their way to the <hi>Yaws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador ſpoke neither then, nor at any time elſe of all or any of the former indignities, but this being ſo notorious, he demanded reparation, and that till then he would not ſtir hence toward <hi>Moſco,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet <hi>Demente Baſhmacof Diack</hi> of the <hi>Taynich Deal</hi> coming to him the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:98085:228"/>
&amp; promiſing in his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties name, he ſhould have ſatisfaction, in leſs than a quarter of an hours ſpace he condeſcended to make his Entry, and did not ſpend half an hour in ſetting forward.</p>
               <p>But whereas his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners formerly, as now His Embaſſadors, ſay that the Earle of <hi>Carliſle</hi> ſpun out that day alſo until the evening, it was not ſo. But all the time that was ſpun out, was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Doomnoy Duoranin Evan Offanaſſevich Pronchiſſof,</hi> who though he were ſent forth to the Embaſſador to be his <hi>Priſtaf</hi> into <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> ſat in his Sledd, formalizing a long time, that the Embaſſador ſhould firſt come out of his Sledd to him, and after a tedious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation and agreement before ſo many ſpectators whereby they were to come out together, yet the ſaid <hi>Doomnoy Duoranin</hi> making a feint of ſtepping forward hung in the air among the arms of his attendants to cheat the Embaſſador.</p>
               <p>And the other ſtay, which was very long, was by reaſon of thoſe troops of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and others that were preſent, who to make the guard continue and hold out to the eye were forced ever and anon to make a ſtand, while thoſe that had met the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor before ſhould under the blind of thoſe next to him gallop away behind to fill up a new ſtation forward.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:98085:229"/>And ſo it was night again before the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador could enter, which might have been prevented by expecting one day longer, as the Ambaſſador moved the <hi>Diack</hi> of the <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich Deale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thoſe great Wax-tapers, which the Ambaſſadors ſpeak of in their paper, were in ſo good order, that it is evident it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon a night Entry in good time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand.</p>
               <p>As to the Ambaſſadors firſt Audience it was indeed agreed upon, that it ſhould be upon the ninth of <hi>February,</hi> and the <hi>Doomnoy Duoranin</hi> told the Ambaſſador that was a great ſign of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties favour, yet it was afterwards put off that it muſt not be till the eleventh of <hi>February,</hi> for what contrary reaſon the Ambaſſador knows not.</p>
               <p>Alſo, although at his firſt Audience he told his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, that he had particular commands from his Royal Majeſty concerning Sir <hi>John Hebdon,</hi> yet the Ambaſſador was refuſed to deliver that recommendatory Letter concerning him to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties own hand, but obliged to tender it to his Commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>Alſo at coming to Conference, the Lords Commiſſioners ſtood up alwaies within the Room, without moving to meet the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, and alſo at all Conferences they took the high end of the Table.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:98085:229"/>The Ambaſſador delivered at the firſt Conference a very treatable and courtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of reparation for the miſcarriage of his Entry.</p>
               <p>And though he then ſignified that he could not proceed to other matters of State till that were rectified, yet upon the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners earneſt motion, and ingaging their honours towards his Reparation, he at the ſame time delivered in another Propoſition concerning the reſtitution of the Priviledges.</p>
               <p>And the Reſtitution of the Priviledges is a matter of State joyntly concerning the true brotherly love of both great Princes, and certainly the foundation thereof was laid in the Priviledges.</p>
               <p>To theſe firſt Propoſitions of the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador the Commiſſioners gave in their anſwer, Wherein they aſſume all their own Titles, and name themſelves before the Ambaſſador Extraordinary, but him they call only plain <hi>Knez Charles Howard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo ſpeaking of his Royal Majeſties Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they call him only <hi>Slauopamite,</hi> of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious memory, but his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties Father <hi>Blagenniopamite,</hi> of ever bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Ambaſſadors Entry they now add another pretence, the long time of arraying the Courtiers and military Troops for his Reception.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:98085:230"/>They ſay the Ambaſſador ought not before he came into <hi>Moſco</hi> to have demanded rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and reparation of his being ſtaid the firſt day.</p>
               <p>They accuſe the Ambaſſador for ſtaying the ſecond day.</p>
               <p>And they ſay the Meſſengers by whom the delay was cauſed had been puniſhed, which was not ſo: and if ever the leaſt thing had been done in order thereto the Ambaſſador had deſiſted, and he ſignified frequently to the Commiſſioners, that he himſelf would have interceded for their pardon.</p>
               <p>Then as to the matter of Priviledges, for anſwer they raiſe an high accuſation againſt the whole <hi>Ruſſia</hi> Company, word for word as it was delivered to <hi>Prideaux Cromwel's</hi> Agent, of which nothing was then or ever ſince proved in particular.</p>
               <p>But whereas his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty had given to underſtand to his Royal Majeſty, as if the Priviledges had been taken away in deteſtation of the late Rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> that is only mentioned for numbers ſake.</p>
               <p>But they lay great ſtreſs upon a Letter ſent (they ſay) by his late Majeſty to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty by <hi>Luke Nightingale,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the abrogating of the Priviledges.</p>
               <p>And in this their firſt anſwer they conclude poſitively againſt the granting any Priviledg, not ſo much as blanching it in hanſom words,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:98085:230"/>
as his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty did to <hi>Cromwel</hi> upon the ſame occaſion, wherein he ſaith thus, <hi>And now we the Great Lord by reaſon of theſe times of War cannot enter upon a review of theſe buſineſſes, but for the future Our Tzarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy Majeſties order will be to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, ſuch as may ſtand with the quiet, advantage, friendſhip, and amity of both great Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed in ſome Papers afterwards the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, as now the Ambaſſadors, do lay the excuſe upon the wars, ſeeming to promiſe ſomething when they ſhould be at an end, but in looſe words, and to be expounded according to time and occaſions, as the <hi>Doomnoy Duoranin Evan Offanaſſevich Pron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſſof</hi> did not diſown, when the Ambaſſador (not in order to treat or cloſe, which he could not upon any ſuch conditions) but for better information diſcourſed with him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the words wherein they expreſſed that overture.</p>
               <p>And in this the Commiſſioners firſt paper aforeſaid they conclude with an exception againſt the Title moſt Illuſtrious given by the Embaſſador at his firſt audience to his <hi>Tzarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy</hi> Majeſty, according to the Title uſed in his Royal Majeſties Letter, and by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors to the Predeceſſors of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty. Whereas that firſt Speech of the Embaſſadors was all thorough compoſed of
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:98085:231"/>
the greateſt honour and courtſhip to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty that any thing could be imagined.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the <hi>Poſolkoy Diack Almaze Evanof</hi> one of the Ambaſſadors Commiſſioners did alſo in open <hi>Precas</hi> ſay, that the Title <hi>moſt Illuſtrious</hi> uſed by the Ambaſſador was an unmannerly expreſſion.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador being ſtill further off any reparation of the former affront, but rather finding it fixed upon him by the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners firſt anſwer, and conſidering the abrupt ſtriking off the Priviledges, was not in caſe to propound any further matter of State, and therefore replyed only according to the occaſions naturally given him by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners paper.</p>
               <p>That as to the excuſe of the Meſſengers miſſing their way within four miles of <hi>Moſco,</hi> it was ſcarce poſſible and not probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame firſt day early in the morning, men that came to Sir <hi>John Hebdon</hi> at the <hi>Yaws</hi> from his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty upon a diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occaſion found the way very eaſiy.</p>
               <p>And whereas this firſt pretence was now inched out with another, the long arraying of the troops that they could not be in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs the firſt day (whereas to the contrary, the Embaſſadors themſelves ſay now in their Paper, that thoſe troops waited for the Earle of <hi>Carliſle</hi> that firſt day from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:98085:231"/>
till night) he ſaith, <hi>That it is hard for him to conceive, whereas his</hi> Tzarskoy <hi>Majeſty is able at ſo great diſtances, by the good orders of his Generals in his abſence, to embattle ſo numerous and victorious Armies upon the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den opportunities of fighting an Enemy, that after his ſo ſlow advancing from</hi> Vologda, <hi>and lying three days almoſt under the Gates of his</hi> Tzarskoy <hi>City, the continual attendants upon his own perſon, where they can learn nothing but the most exquiſite order, ſhould not in a whole day be in a poſture to receive the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador of a Friend;</hi> Which is ſo honourable as nothing can be ſaid more, and yet theſe are the words which the Commiſſioners, and now the Ambaſſadors, complain againſt as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties Armies. And afterwards upon his ſaying, they herein perverted his meaning, the Commiſſioners then, and now the Ambaſſadors, quarrel yet further; And ſo wherein the Ambaſſador ſaith, they are ill founded in their exception againſt <hi>Illuſtriſſimus,</hi> as though it were not lawful for a Stranger in <hi>Moſcovy</hi> to ſpeak truth, and an Ambaſſador muſt diſcourſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tuition.</p>
               <p>He alſo required in his Majeſties name the ſight of that Letter of <hi>Nightingales,</hi> and that being ſo falſe and reflecting ſo highly upon his late Majeſties memory, it might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into his hands. Which the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:98085:232"/>
would never produce, though kept it up ſtill as a pretence, and at the laſt being urged to it, ſaid that it was loſt, but aſſoon as they could find it (which they never would) he ſhould have it.</p>
               <p>He alſo alledged his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties promiſe by letter to his Royal Majeſty to reſtore the Priviledges at the coming of His Embaſſador.</p>
               <p>He anſwered the accuſation againſt the Merchants, replyed to their exception againſt <hi>Illuſtriſſimus,</hi> and admoniſhed the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of their omitting his Royal Majeſties Title, <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> of which the Embaſſadors alſo may do well to take notice.</p>
               <p>After this the Embaſſador was invited to dine with his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shellimetof</hi> near <hi>Stolnick</hi> to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty when he came to tell the Embaſſador dinner was ready, ſaid, The <hi>Tzar</hi> commanded him to come to dinner.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doomnoy Duoranin Evan Offonaſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vich Pronchiſſof</hi> propounded to the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador from his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>femouskoy</hi> and <hi>Sibierskoy Tzarwicks</hi> ſhould ſit at a table ſuperiour to the Embaſſadors table.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, though he had only his cap on that day, yet did not ſtir it to the Ambaſſador when he came in to dinner, as neither was he pleaſed to ſtir His cap at the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:98085:232"/>
private Audience hereafter mentioned.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty cauſed not the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to ſit down with him at his own table, but at a table below in the Hall with a <hi>Doomnoy Duoranin and a Stolnick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Boyars</hi> dined at a table at the upper end of the Hall, and their ceremonies during dinner time were ſtill performed to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Embaſſador.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador had not a napkin allowed him at dinner.</p>
               <p>Upon the receit and return of other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers betwixt the Embaſſador and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, who ſatisfied him in nothing, but ſtill affected to make the breaches wider, he deſired to have a private Audience of His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, which though he moved the twenty ſecond of <hi>March</hi> he could not procure ere the twenty ſecond of <hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Commiſſioners tell the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, that in caſe of ſuch Audience he muſt not ſpeak of buſineſs.</p>
               <p>In the mean time His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty upon Palm-ſunday, inviting the Embaſſador to ſee the Ceremonies, the <hi>Stolnick</hi> that was ſent to conduct him, ſtept firſt into the coach and would have the upper hand. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador would not go upon that condition, ſo that he was fain to expect till contrary orders came from his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The Embaſſador in that private Audience
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:98085:233"/>
acquainted his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty how the affaires ſtood betwixt him and his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, anſwered the reaſons againſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, revealed the ſecret of his Royal Majeſties affection toward his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, deſired reparation concerning his Entry, and complained of the <hi>Doomnoy Duoranin Evan Offonaſſevich Pronchiſſof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For he knew that the ſaid <hi>Doomnoy Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranin</hi> ſtrove upon all occaſions to make his perſon odious and to obſtruct his affaires.</p>
               <p>For the ſaid <hi>Doomnoy Duorarin,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador deſiring that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Women might have leave to viſit his Lady (there being a reſtraint to the contrary) ſpake of it to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty in ſo licentious a ſenſe as made the demand appear ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Embaſſador deſiring that <hi>Beuchlin</hi> a <hi>Dutchman</hi> (who dwelt in his houſe, and had a continual free Cabal of <hi>Dutch</hi> Spyes upon the Embaſſador; while before the firſt audience none were ſuffered to enter to the Embaſſador, and alwaies after the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance very ſevere, ſome examined, others repulſt, others beaten) might be removed, ſpecially ſeeing the Lodging was ſo ſtrait, that <hi>Almaz Evanof</hi> the <hi>Poſolskoy Diack</hi> and one of the Commiſſioners ſaid, it was good for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen to ly cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſt the Rats ſhould run away with them, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> openly bragging, that he
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:98085:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhould continue there in ſpight of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, the ſaid <hi>Doomnoy Dvoranin</hi> as being the Ambaſſadors <hi>Priſtaf,</hi> being often urged to effect it, did either neglect or hinder it, ſo that he continued there at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Alſo the ſaid <hi>Doomnoy Dvoranin</hi> telling the Embaſſador one day, that the King of <hi>Poland</hi> had ſent a Meſſenger to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, to beg the mercy and grace of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty to grant him peace, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador replying, that thoſe were terms which the moſt ſubjugated Princes did never deſcend to, but that he was glad to hear his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties affairs were in ſo good a poſture, the ſaid <hi>Doomnoy Dvoranin</hi> went forthwith and acquainted his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with the firſt part of the Embaſſadors reply, but ſo diſguiſed and with ſo ill a gloſs, that he thereby incenſed his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty highly againſt the Embaſſador.</p>
               <p>Beſide his <hi>Tzarkoy</hi> Majeſty having (as is ſaid) done the Ambaſſador the honour to invite him to ſee the Solemnities of Palm-Sunday, the ſaid <hi>Pronchiſſof</hi> afterwards aſking the Ambaſſador how he liked it, and the Ambaſſador witneſſing his ſatisfaction in ſo venerable a Ceremony, the ſaid <hi>Doomnoy Dvoranin</hi> went ſtrait to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, and told him, the Ambaſſador ſaid it was a pretty Comedy, which alſo diſpleaſed his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, as good reaſon. Whereas
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:98085:234"/>
the <hi>Doomnoy Dvoranin</hi> himſelf only uſed thoſe words to the Ambaſſador, aſking him if it were not a pretty Comedy.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Embaſſador diſcourſing with the ſaid <hi>Doomnoy Dvoranin</hi> concerning <hi>Tzar Evan Baſiliwich,</hi> and his deſire and progreſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a marriage with a Lady of the blood Royal of <hi>England,</hi> he moſt irreverently as to both Princes replied, that the ſaid <hi>Tzar Evan Baſilowich</hi> had many ſuch women, ſpeaking it in a very ill ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Moreover the ſaid <hi>Doomnoy Dvoranin</hi> took occaſion ſeveral times to vilify the Preſent ſent by his Royal Majeſty to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty in the preſence of the ſaid Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, and to ſay, that when he ſaw the Tin ſhine he was in good hopes it had been Silver.</p>
               <p>But of theſe things the Embaſſador never ſpoke at any time, till upon this forcible occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his own vindication. But the ſaid <hi>Doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy Duoranin</hi> having ſpoke diſhonorably and faſly concerning the poſture of His Royal Majeſties affairs, and telling him to his face, as if he were a <hi>Poſoulnick</hi> or agent of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia</hi> company, and having told the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador that he neglected his Majeſties affairs in reſpect of the Merchants, and threatning him with his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties diſpleaſure and that His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of him to his Royal Majeſty, as if he
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:98085:234"/>
had tranſgreſſed his inſtructions (which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the <hi>Doomnoy Duoranin</hi> was never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with by the Embaſſador) he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him therewith before his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
               <p>The ſucceſs it ſeems of that private Audience was this. The Embaſſador having together with the <hi>Enliſh</hi> Copy ſubſcribed, given in a <hi>Latin</hi> Copy, tranſlated as near as poſſible, but not ſubſcribed but by his Secretary, having only prepared it to ſave time, and as an help to their <hi>Ruſs</hi> tranſlation, becauſe one of the Commiſſioners <hi>Golozof</hi> underſtood <hi>Latin,</hi> this <hi>Golozof</hi> was imployed ſeveral daies to the Embaſſador to perſwade him ſubſcribe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he <hi>Latin</hi> tranſlation alſo.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Golozof</hi> preſſed under that colour and pretext, that ſo many things being ſaid therein to the honour of His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and of his Royal Majeſties affection toward Him, ſo that it was moſt fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue upon Record, this alſo being ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, it would be ſo much the ſtronger, and as under two witneſſes. But the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador refuſed, as not being his own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p>Yet at laſt, though he gueſt at the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to give His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, he ſubſcribed it with this addition, <hi>Except any difference with the Engliſh,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſoon as they had obtained they diſcovered
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:98085:235"/>
forthwith their true intention.</p>
               <p>Firſt they complain, as if he had ſpoke with diſ-reſpect of <hi>Tzar Ivan Baſilovich,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>That firſt and great Founder of the Amity betwixt the Engliſh and Ruſſian Crowns, and of the Privileges to the Engliſh Nation Tzar Ivan Baſilovich,</hi> becauſe he added not all his other Titles, and they required the Ambaſſador ſhould alter that expreſſion accordingly, which, how reaſonable ſoever, he did.</p>
               <p>Though the Commiſſioners, nevertheleſs the private Audience having been upon the twenty ſecond of <hi>April,</hi> gave to the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador a paper of the twenty fourth of <hi>May,</hi> wherein they named the late King only King <hi>Charles,</hi> and his preſent Majeſties former Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador the Lord <hi>Culpepper,</hi> the meſſenger <hi>William Culpepper.</hi> Which horrid, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably wilful miſtake they would never alter till the Embaſſador had taken his laſt leave of His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Then they, as now the Ambaſſadors, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him for an expreſſion concerning the falling in of the Windows at their firſt abrupt refuſal of the Privileges; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtanding was very true.</p>
               <p>And whereas they then, and now the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, lay much load upon an Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the loan of ten thouſand pood of Silver deſired by <hi>Knez Peoter Semonovich,</hi> as
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:98085:235"/>
if the Embaſſador therein offered an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the friendſhip betwixt both Princes, tranſgreſſed His Inſtructions, and his <hi>Tzars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy</hi> Majeſty would, (as he hath now done) complain thereof to His Royal Majeſty: the Embaſſador did then only ſpeak in His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Majeſties perſon, I hope that ſuch a ſum was not deſired for ſuch an end, &amp;c. And His Royal Majeſty doth ſtill hope ſo.</p>
               <p>Then as to the <hi>Doomnoy Duoranin,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo juſt and high a complaint prefer'd againſt him, he was the man choſen to come next from His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty to enquire of the Ambaſſadors health, and was ſo imployed for many days as afore.</p>
               <p>At laſt indeed there was another <hi>Priſtaf</hi> appointed in his place, truly a much civiler perſon, but of leſſer quality, which is the preſent Ambaſſador of His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty. But it was ſignified from His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Maj<hi rend="sup">ty.</hi> by <hi>Gregory Coſmevich</hi> the other <hi>Priſtaf</hi> to the Embaſſador, that this removal was upon the <hi>Doomnoy Duoranins</hi> own deſire to be diſmiſt.</p>
               <p>Alſo no Reparation was given the ſaid Embaſſador againſt the <hi>Doomnoy Duoranin,</hi> but in a paper afterwards delivered, he was juſtified in all theſe enormities, and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador accuſed, that after all theſe provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and the charge given up againſt him to His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, the Embaſſador
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:98085:236"/>
would not as formerly diſcourſe with him of affairs of the Embaſſy, as if he had there in affronted the ſaid <hi>Doomnoy Duoranin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the Entry nothing of Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be given.</p>
               <p>The Embaſſador had during this time a power that came for mediating betwixt His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty and the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> which he imparted to his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, and He kindly accepted, but not being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to effect any thing in the Privileges it fell to the ground.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Embaſſador having even from the 29. of <hi>February</hi> intimated his deſire to depart, and having been held up from time to time ſeveral moneths to no end, ſo that he loſt the Winter way to <hi>Riga,</hi> to the prejudice of his Royal Majeſties occaſions, preſsed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately for a diſpatch, which it was long before he could obtain, and when near ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in one and the ſame day had three times contrary orders ſent him about his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
               <p>At the Embaſsadors taking leave of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty, recredentials were given him, wherein his Royal Majeſties Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi> was omitted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the mutual truſt due to an Embaſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor the Copy was, although he demanded it, flatly refuſed him.</p>
               <p>After he had taken his leave of his <hi>Tzarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy</hi>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:98085:236"/>
Majeſty, it ſeems his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty was deſirous to have placed ſome marks of his generoſity upon the Embaſſador and his retinue, and the not receiving of them is uſed by the Embaſsadors of his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty in aggravation againſt him, whereas that buſineſs paſt in this manner. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, it is true, had for ſeveral reaſons hereafter expreſsed reſolved, that it became him not to receive the Preſents, unleſs thoſe things were rectified. And therefore, to avoid the ill aſpect of refuſing them after they ſhould be ſent, he reſolved alſo firſt to ſend for the <hi>Ockolnichoy Vaſilia Semonovich Volinskoy</hi> and for <hi>Larivon Mitrevich Lopookin Poſolkoy Diack</hi> to communicate his reaſons: For which he thought he had time enough, his <hi>Priſtafs</hi> (whoſe office it is) not having yet advertiſed him. But contrariwiſe <hi>Lookian Timopheovich Golozof</hi> the <hi>Diack,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſsador being at dinner, ſends him word by a ſervant, that he was coming with the Preſents. The Embaſsador riſing from Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and about to ſend to the <hi>Ockolnichoy</hi> and <hi>Poſolkoy Diack</hi> aforeſaid, deſired the Servant to ſtay a little, when on a ſudden <hi>Lookian</hi> comes in with the Sables. The Embaſsador began to diſcourſe ſoberly with him of his unexpected coming, and the reaſons why he deliberated upon refuſing the Preſent. Which <hi>Lookian</hi> would not endure to hearken
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:98085:237"/>
to, but interrupting the Ambaſſador conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, without any patience and with great clamour, flung rudely away from him and departed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vaſilius Semonovitch Volinskoy</hi> came the next day to the Embaſſador, deſiring from his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty to be informed of the reaſons why he had refuſed the Preſents.</p>
               <p>The Embaſſador it ſeems had in order to his departure demanded ſeveral things of Common right or courteſie,</p>
               <p>As Satisfaction to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants for their old debts and houſes. For this the Commiſſioners reduced the debts within twenty ſix Rubles according to their account, and for houſes nothing.</p>
               <p>That all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants deſiring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair home may have their Paſſes to go over Sea with their Wives and Families without moleſtation. This had a ſatisfactory anſwer.</p>
               <p>But to the third, That juſtice might be done the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants for their debts, there was no care at all of it, but to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary great ſeverity toward them: ſo that this fruſtrated the former anſwer which was ſatisfactory.</p>
               <p>That all his Majeſties Subjects of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other condition may upon their deſire have full liberty to return. To which there would no anſwer be given in writing: But the verbal anſwer was, that they who have
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:98085:237"/>
once taken ſervice under his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, though not expreſſed for life, yet if not expreſſed for term of Years, are thereby Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as long as his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty pleaſes. As it ſeemed they intended to practiſe it in the caſe of General <hi>Dyel</hi> and Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Drummond,</hi> who were forced ſo long to march about <hi>Moſco</hi> with his Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Letter, and could get none to receive it.</p>
               <p>That Collonel <hi>Baily</hi> accuſed of Treaſon by <hi>Cherillo Clopoue</hi> might be brought to a ſpeedy trial. Which though his accuſer was in Town and promiſed, yet would not be done.</p>
               <p>That Collonel <hi>James Mein</hi> exiled with his Wife and Family into <hi>Siberia</hi> might if guilty have mercy, if guiltleſs juſtice. See the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility of the anſwer, Collonel <hi>Jacob Mein</hi> is ſent into <hi>Siberia</hi> for a great fault, and it is not fit to recal him out of <hi>Siberia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Collonel <hi>Cuningham</hi> accuſed of Treaſon might be brought to a ſpeedy trial. Which would not be granted.</p>
               <p>That Mrs. <hi>Francis Roſe</hi> according to his Royal Majeſties deſires by Letter may have liberty to return into <hi>England,</hi> her Husband alſo deſiring it. Which was not granted, but her being of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Religion alledged, as extinguiſhing her allegeance.</p>
               <p>The Embaſsador upon a general review of theſe and all other paſſages in his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:98085:238"/>
gave for anſwer and reaſon of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi> omitted in the Kings Title, The late Kings Title and Lord <hi>Culpeppers</hi> not amended, No ſatisfaction about his Entrance, Nor concerning <hi>Pronchiſſof,</hi> His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty holding himſelf for affronted, &amp;c. The Priviledges as good as refuſed, <hi>Nightingales</hi> Letter pretended to be loſt, No juſtice to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, No li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for his Majeſties Subjects upon expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their obligations to depart, Affirmed in writing, that the <hi>Moſcovy</hi> Company killed the King, Mrs. <hi>Roſe,</hi> Collonel <hi>Mein,</hi> Collonel <hi>Baily,</hi> &amp;c. Concluding that all the effect of this Embaſſy had been only the releaſe of three <hi>Engliſh</hi> common Soldiers (taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners from the <hi>Pole</hi>) after long ſollicitation, and upon condition that two of them ſhould ſerve his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty. Adding moreover, That for all theſe reaſons he knew, that not having done his Majeſties buſineſs, and lying ſtill under <hi>Pronchiſſofs</hi> aſperſion of receiving the Merchants money, and accuſed by his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſty of doing an affront to Him, it befitted him not to receive any Preſent at his hand. Although otherwiſe he ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the leaſt favour from his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties hand a perpetual ornament, honor, and obligation to himſelf and Family, and would receive though it were but a Cap cloth from Him as a Coronet, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:98085:238"/>
at any time when theſe things were rectified to receive any teſtimony of His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties remembrance and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>After this the 24. of <hi>June</hi> the Embaſſador departed from <hi>Moſco, Calthof</hi> riding publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and openly in his Train. The Embaſſador being about half a mile out of Town, a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Poſolskoy Precaz</hi> comes in His <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties name to demand him. The Ambaſſador at laſt let him got hinking it not prudent to adventure his own journey on <hi>Calthofs,</hi> and hoping to gain his diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; which he tried by two Letters writ back, in his journey, to the <hi>Poſolskoy Diack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the Letters the Embaſſadors complain of in two places, as if the Earle of <hi>Carliſle</hi> told them therein, that they did not rightly underſtand themſelves; Wheras the words are only, <hi>Quorſum haec vergant neſcio, neque vos ipſi ſcitis qui facitis,</hi> What theſe things tend to I know not, neither do you your ſelves that do them. For indeed who knows what will be the event of all theſe actions, unleſs he had the ſpirit of Prophecy? And if the Embaſſador had meant to blame the Commiſſioners underſtanding, he gives them no worſe than he firſt aſſumed to himſelf in this expreſſion.</p>
               <p>But whereas his <hi>Tzarskoy</hi> Majeſties Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors pretend that <hi>Calthof</hi> was taken away
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:98085:239"/>
becauſe his time was not out, and the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador deſired not leave for him at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, it is notoriouſly otherwiſe. For the Embaſſador did day by day urge his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the <hi>Diack</hi> of the <hi>Taynich Deale</hi> anſwered, that he might freely depart. For the the time for which he had conditioned was fully expired, and accordingly by the Law of Nations he was free to have departed with the Embaſſador of his own Prince, without leave asking ar any other formality. Indeed after the Embaſſadors departure, the ſaid <hi>Calthof</hi> was forced by impriſonment and other hardſhip to take conditions for two Years more.</p>
               <p>And this was the accompt his Excellency gave of his firſt Embaſſy. The Anſwer given from his Majeſty to the <hi>Tzars</hi> Embaſſadors was, that he ſaw no reaſon he had to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the proceedings of his Ambaſſador. That if the Earle of <hi>Carliſle</hi> was not perhaps very well informed of the Cuſtomes of the Court of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> he had nevertheleſs been ſo ſtrangely uſed on ſeveral occaſions, that he had more reaſon to complain than his <hi>Tzarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koy</hi> Majeſty. And whereas his Embaſſadors had very earneſtly preſſed the Friendſhip the the <hi>Tzar</hi> had for the King of <hi>England;</hi> the King declared, that he could hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:98085:239"/>
of his affection till he ſaw the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation re-eſtabliſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Priviledges of the Merchants his Subjects. His Excellency having in this manner been juſtified againſt the attempts of the <hi>Ruſs</hi> Embaſſador, who had uſed all the art poſſible to deſtroy him, in civility he made him a viſit. After which the <hi>Ruſs</hi> Embaſſador departed for his own Country, not over well ſatisfied with his Voiage; &amp; a while after his Majeſty diſpatched Sir <hi>John Hebdon</hi> thither in quality of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyè Extraordinary, but without any ſucceſs. So that things continue ſtill in the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, betwixt the two Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Moſcovy.</hi>
